"Passage: Dawn of DarknessDark clouds blocked out the sun. Thunder rolled and boomed, as lightning lit up the skies. Below, the salty waves tossed and tumbled, growing larger as the wind whipped and raged from the north. The rain came down in torrents, pelting the deck of the wooden ship, and soaking the wood. The first mate barked out orders to the crew who busied themselves to carry those orders out. The sails were taken in, so as to not be blown off course. The idea was to wait out the storm, as the waves weren’t so bad that they needed to get out of danger. Near the bow, on top deck, a woman cloaked in a silver robe stood by a man who was robbed in royal purple. Both had crowns fastened to their heads. Soldiers stood by, on edge from the storm, but otherwise relaxed. The man smiled down at his wife and looked to the small bundle of joy she held in her arms. A small child, nearly a year old, rested against her mother’s breast. She had dark, nearly obsidian black hair. Her emerald green eyes were closed now, resting while the storm raged on around them. Her little fingers curled tightly around her mother’s necklace. Their calm was shattered by the sound of lightning as it hit the main mast. The following boom of thunder was loud enough to wake the dead. Deckhands scrambled as they tried to put out the fire that was quickly spreading, but another bolt of lighting struck the ship near the stern, and soon they understood their battle with the flames was a lost cause. The captain readied the life boats, and had the king and queen begin to board. A large wave crashed into the side of the ship and the queen and her child were sent flying over the side. The life boat was lowered down into the unforgiving seas. The queen tried to stay close to the boat, but between holding her child’s head above the waves and the weight of her attire, she was quickly losing strength. She felt something brush up against her. The queen was so tired at this point, her arm holding her child threatened to release her. She saw the life boat coming for her, she knew she would be safe soon. But her child.. Suddenly she felt her child being taken from her arms, as if the water itself was wishing her to drop the child. She screamed up at the skies to whatever god might be listening. “Save my baby, please! Save my Allene!” Something came up from the waves, a sleek head, covered in scales, long like a horse’s. two horns upon the top of it’s head that looked like blackened icicles, Nearly glowing blue orbs seemed to bring the queen into a state of shock. This was a water dragon. Feared for their ever-changing moods, and loved for their kindness. The desperate mother, without a thought, handed her child up to the dragon, who took it in it’s maw gently. But as the life boats came closer, the dragon’s eyes became a glare. There was a man raging in the small life boat, he was screaming out of fear, and waved a sword in the air. The dragon gave a deep growl and sunk below the waves. The queen screamed in horror as she watched her baby disappear beneath the black waves, her strength gave out and she began to sink, hoping to join her child in a watery grave. Large hands pulled at her soaked body before she could embrace the darkness that surrounded her and she was pulled into the chaos of life. She sobbed openly as her king held her, the dread and hatred in his eyes was enough to keep the crew silent while they worked on getting everyone safely to shore. The closest line of safety being Conach Moore, an island that held many mountains. On the eastern side there was a small village that would be able to help them get home to Riochtdome. Beneath the unforgiving waves, in the calm depths of the ocean, the water dragon still carried the young child in it’s maw, a protective barrier surrounded it so that water did not enter the child’s lungs. The dragon had sensed darkness in the King’s heart and sought to save both the mother and the child, but when she had looked for the mother, the king was already pulling her with him. With a heavy heart she took the child to her home, Farlig Dyre. It was a rather large island, filled with forests, mountains, rivers, and plains. It was a beautiful land where Humans dared not tread, and Dragons lived peacefully. She swam up to the edge of the massive cliff that served as a shoreline, digging her claws into the rough earth as she hauled her long, lithe body up the mountainous wall. Her deep blue scales dripped water and left a wet trail as she climbed over the wall and onto the soft lush grass of the northern forest. She placed the now awake, and yet peaceful child, onto the ground. She held her massive head to the sky and beckoned her elders with a roar. As she waited for the sounds of familiar wings beating against the wind, she gathered a few logs and used her claw to dig a small, shallow hole She placed the logs inside and lit a fire with her maw. Her fire was blue, but unlike most fires, it wasn’t as hot as it should be. It was warm, like a sunny day rather than a bursting inferno. She placed the child near the edge of it so as to keep it warm, spreading one of her small wings over her so as to keep her dry. She curled herself up around the child the mother had called Allene, and looked to the skies, awaiting the judgment of her elders. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the climactic event of the story."	"Both the king and queen are hanging on to the sides of their watery life raft as the ship burns and begins to sink. The queen has a baby in her arms and screams in horror when she is taken away from her child by the flowing water. She screams to the heavens for help and a water dragon appears to save them. She is horrified as she watches the man in the nearby lifeboat make an attempt to decapitate the dragon who had tried to save the child. The dragon gives a deep growl and submerges underwater, while keeping the child safe in its maw. ******A storm causes a ship to catch fire, and the queen and her child go sailing overboard. The mother hands her child over to a water dragon. When the mother's kin shows up, the dragon takes the child and retreats. The water dragon takes the child to Farlig Dyre and shelters and cares for it.******The queen and her baby fall off a ship during a storm. A water dragon saves the baby from the waters and takes it to its home on Farlig Dyre. They arrive on the island, and the dragon makes a fire to keep the baby warm. There, the water dragon awaits its elders who will give their judgement.******The dramatic event is when all of the people on the ship in a storm are thrown into the sea when lightning strikes near the bow. The queen tries to get on the lifeboat, but the waves throw her and her baby off the ship. She sees a massive water dragon lift up her infant to save it, but the dragon is unable to take the mother. The dragon swims to an island called Farlig Dyr where she places the babe and keeps it dry.******The ship of the royal family is caught in a storm. In the feverish chaos, the queen and her baby accidentally falls into the sea. The baby is rescued by a dragon when the queen's strength fails to hold her child. As the lifeboat approaches the queen, she watches in horror when the dragon dives underwater to take the baby away.******The climax of the story seems to be when the passenger asks the narrator why he thinks of the sledding day as the best day he's ever had. The narrator tenses up after that and begins to explain the realities of being a cab driver. "

She begs the gods to save her child and when she sees the water dragon, she desperately hands her baby to the dragon. When the dragon dives underwater after seeing the lifeboats approach, the queen is horrified and think that her child will drown so she wants to die. She is extremely sad at the end, thinking her child is dead and also possibly dreading being with the king, who, according to the story, has darkness in his heart.******The queen changes significantly over the course of the story. She starts off as a mother concerned for her child's safety in the middle of a storm. Desperate, she turns to a water dragon to save her child.

She drops her child and falls into the water, screaming out for her child to be saved. Later her child is taken by a water dragon, who places the child on an island. The queen sinks into the water, exhausted and helpless. She is hauled into the life boat but is inconsolable.******The queen was standing near the bow of the ship with the king, holding her 1-year-old baby close to her, while the storm raged around them. The ship was lost after two direct lightning strikes and the queen and baby was tossed overboard when a wave hit the ship. The queen struggled to hold her baby's head above water while keeping herself afloat with her attire being weighed down. In desperation she hands her baby over to a water dragon to save its life. She screamed in horror as the dragon disappeared with her baby below the waves and longed for the same watery grave, but strong hands pulled her into a life boat. She cried into the king's shoulder for her lost child."

"Passage: President Trump abruptly announced Tuesday that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is withdrawing from consideration to lead the Pentagon and he's naming Secretary of the Army Mark Esper as his replacement.While speculation has brewed for days about Shanahan's status, the announcement came shortly after the publication of an explosive USA Today report that the FBI has been probing a violent domestic dispute from 2010 between Shanahan and his then-wife as part of his background investigation.Speaking to reporters outside the White House, the president said, “it's a difficult time for Pat,” adding Shanahan would take “some time off for family matters.”WHO IS MARK ESPER, TRUMP’S NEW ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PICK?“Mark Esper will be outstanding,” the president said of Shanahan’s replacement. “And, we look forward to working with him for a long period of time to come.”In a resignation letter Tuesday, Shanahan said “it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way in the course of this process.”  The Pentagon said Shanahan's resignation will take effect at midnight Sunday.“I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal,” Shanahan said. “Ultimately, their safety and well-being is my highest priority.”He added, “I would welcome the opportunity to be Secretary of Defense, but not at the expense of being a good father.”[]After the 2010 incident, Shanahan and then-wife Kimberley both told police the other punched them, according to USA Today. Shanahan denied the allegations. ""Though my marriage ended in sorrow and disappointment, I never laid a hand on my then-wife and cooperated fully in a thorough law enforcement investigation that resulted in her being charged with assault against me—charges which I had dropped in the interest of my family,” Shanahantold USA Today.The Washington Postalso published a story Tuesday detailing other domestic violence incidents involving Shanahan's family, including how his son was arrested in 2011 after allegedly beating his mother with a baseball bat. The Post said Shanahan defended his son, saying at the time he acted in self-defense. Shanahan told the paper this week that resurfacing the incident “will ruin my son’s life,” while backing away from his original self-defense claim.Without referencing the reporting, Trump announced on Twitter earlier Tuesday the acting secretary will not go forward with confirmation in order to focus on his family.“Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,” the president tweeted. “I thank Pat for his outstanding service and will be naming Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to be the new Acting Secretary of Defense. I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!”Esper has served as secretary of the United States Army since 2017. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986 — the same year as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Last month, the White House announced Trump's intention to have Shanahan permanently lead the department, following his time serving as acting secretary. At the time, Shanahan said he was ""honored"" by Trump's decision.“If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,"" he said. ""I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.”[In this April 2, 2019, file photo, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper speaks during a House Armed Services Committee budget hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)But in recent days, there were signs that Shanahan’s confirmation had stalled, as the Senate Armed Services Committee -- the panel that would have held hearings on the nomination -- still had not received paperwork formally nominating Shanahan to the position. Fox News was told the panel was still waiting for paperwork from the FBI’s background check.Shanahan worked at Boeing for over 30 years before coming to the Pentagon as then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s deputy at the start of the Trump administration. He has filled the role of acting defense secretary since Mattis' resignation last year._Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report._ Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the controversy surrounding Shanahan."	"Shanahan was being considered for the position of Secretary of Defense, but he withdrew his name from consideration after a USA Today report that the FBI was probing a violent domestic dispute between Shanahan and his then-wife in 2010. Shanahan said that he would not continue with the confirmation process because it would force his children to relive a traumatic chapter in their family's life and reopen wounds they had worked years to heal. Other domestic violence incidents have been reported that Shanahan wants to avoid bringing attention to, including his son's arrest in 2011."

The circle packing theorem states that a circle packing exists if and only if the pattern of adjacencies forms a planar graph; it was originally proved by Paul Koebe in the 1930s, and popularized by William Thurston, who rediscovered it in the 1970s and connected it with the theory of conformal maps and conformal geometry. As a topic, this should be distinguished from sphere packing, which considers higher dimensions (here, everything is two dimensional) and is more focused on packing density than on combinatorial patterns of tangency.The book is divided into four parts, in progressive levels of difficulty. The first part introduces the subject visually, encouraging the reader to think about packings not just as static objects but as dynamic systems of circles that change in predictable ways when the conditions under which they are formed (their patterns of adjacency) change. The second part concerns the proof of the circle packing theorem itself, and of the associated rigidity theorem: every maximal planar graph can be associated with a circle packing that is unique up to Möbius transformations of the plane. More generally the same result holds for any triangulated manifold, with a circle packing on a topologically equivalent Riemann surface that is unique up to conformal equivalence.The third part of the book concerns the degrees of freedom that arise when the pattern of adjacencies is not fully triangulated (it is a planar graph, but not a maximal planar graph). In this case, different extensions of this pattern to larger maximal planar graphs will lead to different packings, which can be mapped to each other by corresponding circles. The book explores the connection between these mappings, which it calls discrete analytic functions, and the analytic functions of classical mathematical analysis. The final part of the book concerns a conjecture of William Thurston, proved by Burton Rodin and Dennis Sullivan, that makes this analogy concrete: conformal mappings from any topological disk to a circle can be approximated by filling the disk by a hexagonal packing of unit circles, finding a circle packing that adds to that pattern of adjacencies a single outer circle, and constructing the resulting discrete analytic function. This part also includes applications to number theory and the visualization of brain structure.Stephenson has implemented algorithms for circle packing and used them to construct the many illustrations of the book, giving to much of this work the flavor of experimental mathematics, although it is also mathematically rigorous. Unsolved problems are listed throughout the book, which also includes nine appendices on related topics such as the ring lemma and Doyle spirals.Audience and receptionThe book presents research-level mathematics, and is aimed at professional mathematicians interested in this and related topics. Reviewer Frédéric Mathéus describes the level of the material in the book as “both mathematically rigorous and accessible to the novice mathematician”, presented in an approachable style that conveys the author's love of the material. However, although the preface to the book states that no background knowledge is necessary, and that the book can be read by non-mathematicians or used as an undergraduate textbook, reviewer Michele Intermont disagrees, noting that it has no exercises for students and writing that “non-mathematicians will be nothing other than frustrated with this book”. Similarly, reviewer David Mumford finds the first seven chapters (part I and much of part II) to be at an undergraduate level, but writes that “as a whole, the book is suitable for graduate students in math”.

"Passage: Despite the name, Scotch tape wasn't invented by the Scottish. It was invented by a college dropout named Richard Drew from Minnesota who worked for a small sandpaper company founded in 1902 called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, later known as 3M. The name ""Scotch"" itself has an origin story almost as interesting as the invention of Scotch tape.Born Richard Gurley Drew in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1899, Drew spent a year at the University of Minnesota in the Mechanical Engineering program before dropping out. He paid for that time at school and his correspondence school course in machine design by playing banjo, and he included all of that information in his application to the open position of lab technician with 3M. He got the job and was set on the path to make history.In the 1920s, a two-tone paint job was popular for cars and a headache for automotive painters. The two-tone look was created by painting the car one color, applying a barrier of some sort to the painted portion, and then painting the next section. In order to get around the difficulties of this type of paint job, painters and mechanics tested out different ways to achieve the look. Unfortunately, their attempts tended to be less than successful. Some automotive shops would glue newspapers over the already painted sections while others used tape to prevent paint transfer. However those techniques often left a sticky residue on the paint that was difficult to remove. Sometimes, it would even mean the painters had to do the entire paint job over again.One of Drew's responsibilities at 3M was to deliver samples of sandpaper to local automotive shops for testing, where he often overheard workers who were painting complain about the problems with tape used for these paint jobs. The twenty-three year old then lab assistant got the idea to create a new tape that would create a seal so that the paint wouldn't get through and yet also come off clean without leaving any sticky residue that ruined the paint finish. Drew used the adhesive that 3M utilized in the construction of its sandpaper as a starting point. From there, it took him two years of experimentation with different types of adhesives that he applied to a crepe paper backing to come up with the right combination. Thus, what would be called ""Scotch"" Masking Tape was born in 1925.The success of the Scotch Brand Masking Tape allowed Drew to move up the ranks at 3M. In 1929, his position as technical director at the fabrication laboratory allowed him to pursue another idea. Cellophane had recently been invented by DuPont and was being used by grocers and bakers as a neat way to package their groceries. However, there wasn't a good way to seal the cellophane with tape because the colored backing ruined the clear look. So Drew and his team of inventors worked to create a tape that used this clear cellophane as a backing.G/O Media may get a commissionUnfortunately, the machinery that 3M used in order to apply the adhesive to the cellophane backing tore the material, and the glue that worked for the masking tape appeared amber on the clear cellophane. The team ultimately invented new clear adhesive and modified machinery to handle the cellophane. The new tape was called Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape, but it appeared that it might have missed its opportunity with grocers and bakers despite ringing endorsements from several test clients. You see, DuPont had introduced into the market a cellophane that could be sealed with heat. Nonetheless, despite missing their original target market and being released during the Great Depression, the Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape thrived with various home uses.So this all brings us back to how the term ""Scotch"" came to be associated with 3M's Masking and Cellulose tapes. When Drew and 3M began allowing car painters to test the new Scotch Brand Masking Tape, one painter supposedly complained about the lack of adhesive on the tape. One version of the story claims that the painter asked ""Why so Scotch with the adhesive?"" Another version states that the painter said ""Take this back to your Scotch bosses and tell them to put more adhesive on it.""Whatever the case, in the 1920s, the term ""Scotch"" was a racial slang term that meant something or someone that was cheap or stingy. Based on the feedback, Drew applied more adhesive to the tape and ultimately branded the tape with the pejorative ""stingy"" name of ""Scotch.""If you liked this article, you might also enjoy:-   What the Company Name ""3M"" Stands For-   The Invention Nobody Wanted That Became One of the Top Selling Office Products of All Time-   A Brief History of the Ballpoint Pen and Whether NASA Really Spent Millions Developing a Pressurized Version Instead of Just Using Pencils-   Super Glue was Invented by Accident, Twice-   Who Invented Duct Tape------------------------------------------------------------------------_Sarah Stone writes for the mildly popular interesting fact website_ _TodayIFoundOut.com__.

"The writer used three different components to compose this piece's structure: the salient details of Richard Drew's life and his work in the University, an important background story which is the inception, or beginning of the invention of Scotch masking tape, and the invention of the Scotch tape itself, from inception to conceptualization and the successful release to the populace.******The narrative structure of the informative article follows an origin story centered around Richard Drew and the invention of Scotch tape. The story begins with introducing Drew and explaining the situation in which he made the invention of the tape. The narrative of the article progresses by detailing Drew's method of experimentation and eventual success with the creation of Scotch tape and Scotch masking tape. The article concludes with a brief overview of its success and how it got its name.******She takes the reader through the chronological order of the invention's history and uses corroboration of empirical evidence.******The opening hook of the article teases the origin of the Scotch tape branding. With the reader now interested in the tale, the article proceeds to talk about the inventor of scotch tape, how the tape was invented, and what the inventor did later in their career. Once the entire narrative is finished, it is only then that the writer chooses to resolve original teaser -using its incomplete anecdotal tale as the concluding part of the narrative.******No answer"
"Passage: President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday morning, in which Trump provided cover for Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, elicited some heated criticism from leading Republicans in Congress. This prompted an obvious question: Would Republicans put their money where their mouth is and actually use their power to punish Trump?Well, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked that question at Tuesday presser — and he made it clear the answer was no, at least as far as the GOP leadership was concerned.Here’s the key exchange between Ryan and a reporter:  RYAN: I understand the desire and the need to have good relations. That’s perfectly reasonable. But Russia is a menacing government that does not share our interests and does not share our values. And I think that should be made very, very clear.  REPORTER: What could you do? You guys are a co-equal branch of government. What could you do to make sure he [Trump] doesn’t do something ...  RYAN: Here’s what we can do, and here’s what we have already done — which is to put sanctions on Russia. ... We’d already put in place sanctions. If the [House] Foreign Affairs Committee or the Financial Service Committee — or the Senate Banking Committee — think that there are other sanctions that we have not yet put in place on Russia, I’m more than happy to consider those.Note how weaselly Ryan’s answer is. The question wasn’t, “What are you doing to punish Russia?” It was, “How can you constrain Trump from cozying up even more to Putin?” That isn’t a problem that can be solved by new sanctions. It would require passing legislation that puts limits on the president’s power to change US policy on a whole host of foreign policy issues (like Ukraine or Syria), or block Trump from firing special counsel Robert Mueller and ending the Russia collusion probe.But doing something like that would, of course, provoke a major fight with Trump. Ryan is so unwilling to do that he won’t even think about proposing such measures. Instead, he moves to the safer ground of hypothetical new Russia sanctions that may never actually emerge and that wouldn’t really constrain Trump from changing US policy on Russia.This speaks to a vital point about the GOP’s “backlash” against the Putin meeting. Ultimately, congressional Republicans mostly care more about staying in Trump’s good graces — and avoiding a fight that could jeopardize their legislative agenda and anger the pro-Trump base before the upcoming midterm elections — than about the ways that Trump is taking a hammer to decades of US foreign policy on Russia and other issues.Republicans in Congress simply place a higher value on party unity than on the foreign policy principles they claim to stand for. If they didn’t, Ryan would actually be talking about new laws to constrain Trump.That isn’t a value judgment, or even necessarily a criticism. There’s a case, from the Republican point of view, for refusing to cross Trump even when he tramples on years of conservative orthodoxy.But Ryan isn’t making that case. He, and the rest of the mainstream GOP, is trying desperately to pretend that you can be anti-Putin and pro-Trump. But Monday’s presser made it clear that’s impossible.------------------------------------------------------------------------WILL YOU HELP KEEP VOX FREE FOR ALL?There is tremendous power in understanding.

"John is passionate about music.******The text implies that he's a lover of music, specifically music that's not popular yet. He has various radio shows/podcasts, all of which are centered on music. The awards he's received and worked on have all been music-focused too.******John's work is about introducing music to people. He does covers, interviews, live sessions, and everything in between. With his role as host of the music show X-Posure on Radio X, John has been able to give radio play to numerous unknown artists sparking their careers."
"Passage:  the side of cyberbullies, right?Except there’s one question that didn’t occur to a single senator. What’s cyberbullying?This isn’t exactly a new problem following the Court of Appeals holding in People v. Marquan M. that Albany County’s cyberbullying law was unconstitutional. The issue isn’t whether bullying isn’t a problem or doesn’t do harm, but defining what it is and doing so in a way that doesn’t violate the First Amendment. As Eric Turkewitz explains, that’s hard to do.  There is, of course, lots of conduct that we can all agree is bullying, right?  A kid gets taunted by classmates for his less-than-personal personality, and it’s a no-brainer, right?  Well, almost right. I mean, friends do this kind of stuff to their good buddies after all.  It isn’t just for enemies.  But still, let’s say it is an “enemy” of sorts — two kids that actually hate each other. How do they know where the line in the sand is located as to what is legitimate and what isn’t?  So if Kid A wants to say that Kid B’s support of Trump is “idiotic” or “moronic,” or that Kid B seems to be a clueless asshat for believing what s/he believes, would that conduct, if done online, be cyber-bullying? How about if it didn’t involve politics at all, and was purely personal?  Don’t we have a right to call each other schmucks?This, of course, doesn’t begin to scratch the surface of the problem, neither from the perspective of what is bullying to what is free speech. It’s one of those words that people believe they know when they see, but when put to the test of defining, come up empty.So the New York Senate came up with a solution in SB2318A:  12-A. CYBERBULLYING.  1. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:  A. MINOR SHALL MEAN ANY NATURAL PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN.  B. PERSON SHALL MEAN ANY NATURAL PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL.  2. ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY ENGAGES IN A REPEATED COURSE OF CYBERBULLYING OF A MINOR SHALL BE GUILTY OF AN UNCLASSIFIED MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF NOT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS, OR BY A PERIOD OF IMPRISONMENT NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR, OR BY BOTH SUCH FINE AND IMPRISONMENT.  3. This act shall take effect immediately.Notice anything missing there? No definition of cyberbullying. Not a good one. Not a bad one. None at all. It’s a misdemeanor to engage in a “repeated course of cyberbullying,” but what that might be is anyone’s guess.Is the Senate trying to leave a huge, gaping hole for prosecutors to fill? Or maybe they figure that if the courts are going to be such constitutional sticklers, let judges come up with the definition? Is there any judge so ignorant of law that he wouldn’t toss any prosecution based on this law? Is there any judge willing to create a definition to fill the Senate’s gaping hole? It’s one thing to try to rationalize a statutory definition with constitutional limitations, but this one doesn’t stand a chance.Turk makes the obvious legal observation:  There is no point passing version 2.0 of a law that will one day be ruled unconstitutional.Of course it will, as there is no other conceivable option but to hold this ridiculous attempt to criminalize cyberbullying unconstitutional. But there is, of course, a “point” to passing this shockingly badly written law. It enables senators to tell their constituents how much they hate cyberbullying, how much they love children, how hard they worked to craft a law to criminalize one and protect the other. And when those mean ol’ judges trash the law because of that loophole called the Constitution, it will be on their robed shoulders.Hard as it may be to accept, law is hard, and writing law is very hard. Sometimes, it’s impossible to draft a law that criminalizes conduct that is harmful and wrong because it’s subject to constant variation based on unique circumstances, and any attempt to define it inherently implicates the right to call someone a schmuck. And like it or not, we have the right to say words about other people with whom we disagree in America.But this law is just a cynical attempt to game the emotions of the electorate, as it has absolutely no chance of passing constitutional muster. The senators didn’t even give it a try, and as much as they may not be the sharpest knives in the legislature, even they know that you can’t criminalize cyberbullying by defining it as cyberbullying.The one thing they do know is that the voters won’t think any harder than they worked on drafting a viable law, and will kvell over their concern for the children. And really, isn’t the what law is all about, getting re-elected? Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about cyberbullying?"	"Cyberbullying is something we think we can identify when we see it, but how exactly is it bullying as opposed to an expression of opinion? Cyberbullying is a crime in New York, but the law defining it is vague and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.******Bullying is a problem and causes harm, but defining what it is in a way that does not violate the First Amendment is nearly impossible. The New York Senate did not attempt to define cyberbullying at all but wrote SB2318A in such a way that cyberbullying is defined as cyberbullying. It might have been their intention that a judge develop the definition because it is extremely difficult to write a law that criminalizes conduct that is harmful and wrong and that is also subject to constant variation based on unique circumstances.******The text mentions that while the Albany County's cyberbullying law was unconstitutional, defining what it is and doing so in a way that doesn't violate the First Amendment is difficult.******It's unclear what cyberbullying is. The author notes that any legal definition of cyberbullying would probably violate the First Amendment.******The text does not define cyberbullying."

"Passage: PRIMOŽ (pronounced ['pɾimɔʒ]) is a high hill overgrown with trees[1], and is a part of a ridge separating the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It has many marked trails and a macadamized road leading to its peak. There is a historical trail intended for tourists with many information signs around its peak. It served an important military role during the Second World War, since it contained many tunnels and bunkers used by Italian army.[2]It is named after St. Primož and the Felicijan church, which was abandoned in the eighteenth century with practically no ruins leftover.[3]LocationPrimož is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. The town of Pivka is built on the northern and northeastern slopes of Primož.[4] It has a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin which contributed to its military importance during the Second World War.HistoryAfter the end of World War 1, Primož hill became Italian territory following an agreement between Italy, Great Britain, France and Russia alongside South Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia and various islands in the Adriatic sea. On November 12th, 1920, the border was drawn in accordance with the Treaty of Rapallo, crossing the Pivka basin, on the ridge of the Javorniki mountain chain. Primož's military tunnels were dug in 1930 as a part of the long Alpine Wall, a vast series of Italian Defense fortifications. The tunnels consisted of two lines; one directly on the border, and the second one a few kilometers behind it. Locals were kept away from the tunnels, and were only allowed to bring basic materials and food near its premises. The tunnels were constructed only by verified members of the Italian National Fascist Party.[5] The tunnels were secured with steel plates coated with a thick layer of concrete.

"Primož was a part of a ridge that separated the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It was located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. Primož had a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin and military tunnels dug by the Italians which made it important during the Second World War.******Primož was an important military location during the Second World War due to the tunnels, bunkers, and military history. While the tunnels were never used, they could have been of use to military personnel. Being a hill, Primož also has a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin which added to its strategic military importance. ******Primož is a high hill situated along a ridge that divides the Pivka Basin from the Reka Valley. Primož served as an important strategic location since from its peak, the entire Pivka Basin could be seen. As such, a number of tunnels and bunkers were constructed on the hill during World War 1 but were never used, even during WW2. ******Primož is part of a ridge (Javorniki mountain) that separates the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It contained many bunkers and tunnels used by the Italian army. The edge of the cliff borders the Pivka basin and has commanding views of the valley.******Primož is part of a ridge that separates the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It possesses a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin, making it an important military location. During the Second World War, it was fortified with tunnels as part of the Alpine Wall, yet they were never used in combat. In total, the tunnels were more than two kilometers long, but they have since been abandoned. Today, it is made accessible by marked trails, with one specifically designated for tourists and containing numerous information signs around its peak. Primož's strategic importance stems from its commanding view and its military tunnels."
"Passage: They came for him during the group session, two well dressed boys on the cusp of manhood. This wasn’t the first time a young and the restless soul had come asking questions about her, her legend, after all did precede her. Ted drew a deep breath that made his thin hospital gown rise and fall like an undulating wave, he looked at the floor. Those who knew him best recognised the act, this story was the last light of the broken man who sat before them in the New Haven Detoxification Institute. Ted meekly raised his hand, begging for silence. The regulars inched closer ready for the words they’d heard so many times before.“Assia, Assia, ascended astrologers muse. Assia, Assia, Aphrodite’s repose. Assia, Assia, fire of life, cold when she goes.” The room hushed as if smothered, those watching felt a peculiar prickling of the skin. Ted continued oblivious. .It was dusk, turning twilight, when they arrived at the bar. Ted tall and thin, his companion slightly taller with a thicker build. It was darker in the bar, one of those cheap places that tries to make up for a lack of style with poor lighting. She was late. He was in love with her. Ted was oblivious of what was to come.The friend looked up, startled. Assia stood before them. Rain dripped from her night black hair that shone with the subtlest hint of a crimson glow. Her short black dress showed of her curves, like those of a racing car. Her legs were bare. Presently her eyes met Ted’s who suddenly aware that the world was turning at an astronomical rate around the fixed point of his eyes locked with hers. Every second was eternal.Ted’s mind raced with this new information. Who was this girl? What the hell is this feeling? Oh god, make eye contact! OH GOD too much eye contact! Confused Ted withdrew from conversation and fixed his eyes on the wall sized aquarium behind Assia’s head. A thousand fish swam to and fro together in a shoal. One fish danced alone, swishing elegantly like Mata Hari. The tank appeared empty, but for this one fish. Ted sat transfixed, stealing occasional glances at the girl, but always returning to that one solitary fish. The fish disappeared. The sea was lonely.Ted sipped his drink quickly. Assia demurely ashed her cigarette, delicately brushing it against the crystal ashtray, all the while stealing glances at Ted of her own. That moment the dreamer in him fell in love with her, and he soon knew it. Fire, crash the next hours passed lightning fast. Growing bolder the pair revelled in ideas, wallowed, and bathed in mutual knowledge and interests. Their friend faded to grey and they were alone.Alone on a sofa now, memories slip by as if in a film. Hand brushes leg. Leg brushes hand. Electricity. Magnetism draws them together. His hands her hips. Her hands his hair. His lips her lips. Ecstasy. Her phone rings and she goes.. Ted stood up, opened his eyes and spoke to his fellow New Haven Institute patients. The memory had almost seemed real.  “That was the first and last time I laid eyes Assia Do Nascimento. I chased the idea, the dream, the memory of her all my life. Trying to capture a love so pure, so intense.” Ted sat down hands trembling “You never know what will set the memory off.” Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:How does Assia feature in this story?"	"Assia is the object of Ted's affection. She is an attractive woman who left Ted after a one-night stand."
"Passage: [Voting booths are pictured. | Getty]In a state in which voters are reluctant to embrace Republicans, Sharpe plans to present himself as a potential alternative to voters who don’t like Cuomo. | GettyALBANY — The $5.9 million in contributions Gov. Andrew Cuomo received in the past six months easily topped the growing field of potential challengers this year.Who came in second place? Not Republican Brian Kolb ( who raised $16,026 for governor on top of $42,387 in his Assembly account), Democrat Terry Gipson ($6,092), or Republican Joel Giambra ($0). Republican John DeFrancisco raised $116,452 for a pair of state Senate committees, but has yet to declare whether he’ll seek statewide office.By a wide margin, the declared candidate who received the second-highest contribution total was Larry Sharpe, who’s planning to run on the Libertarian line. He raised $102,596 during the filing period, most of which he said came from small donors who contributed online.In a state in which voters are reluctant to embrace Republicans — Democrats have won the past 19 statewide races — Sharpe plans to present himself as a potential alternative to voters who don’t like Cuomo.“The Republican vote is a wasted vote,” he said. “There is no way a Republican can win in this state. The advantage that I have is I’m not a Republican, I’m a Libertarian. … So when New York state looks at the Republican and says, ‘Not that guy,’ and they look at Cuomo and say, ‘Not that guy’ — I’m their guy.”Sharpe, a former trucking company executive and Marine, sought the national party’s nomination to be Gary Johnson’s running mate in the 2016 national election. He came close, losing with 47 percent of the vote on the second ballot at the party's convention to former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (who once ran for governor in New York himself).He’s already gained Johnson’s endorsement, and partially as a result of his efforts in 2016, Sharpe has a substantial online presence. A Facebook page for his gubernatorial campaign has 41,000 followers. Cuomo’s political page, by comparison, has 129,000, and neither of the two declared Republicans has many more than 3,000.Much of that following and his fundraising likely comes from Libertarians from other states. But the magnitude of it, coupled with the fact that Sharpe already has started to campaign, makes it realistic to imagine a scenario in which he crosses the magic threshold of 50,000 votes.When a candidate hits that number in a gubernatorial election, a little more than 1 percent of the votes cast, the party becomes official in New York. For the next four years, the party has automatic ballot access, appears on voter registration forms and has the state fund its primaries.Eight parties crossed that threshold in 2014. But outside of a 48,359-vote performance by Warren Redlich in 2010, Libertarians have never come particularly close.Sharpe said it was ""a joke"" to talk about his chances of garnering at least 50,000 votes. “I already have a base of [176,000] people who vote for Gary Johnson and Bill Weld in 2016,"" he said. ""I’ll get that easily.”Third-party candidates have rarely been competitive in New York’s gubernatorial races. Paychex founder Tom Golisano drew between 4 and 14 percent of the vote in a trio of campaigns that began in 1994, but there have only been two elections since the Civil War in which a candidate not running on either the Democratic or Republican lines has come close to finishing in even second place.Despite this track record, Sharpe says he’s running not just to legitimize the party, but to win.“Only about 4 million New Yorkers are going to vote,” he said, suggesting that somebody might win election as governor without a majority in a three-way race. “So that means all I need is about 1.5 million and I’m governor. That’s a mountain, but that’s not impossible.”He says there are four areas that will determine who is ultimately elected — traditional media coverage, public speaking, social media and debates. While he’s ready to concede coverage by traditional media, he thinks he can be competitive in the other three.“When it comes to speaking and events, it’s not his skill set, he’s not good at that,” Sharpe said of Cuomo.Cuomo has had lackluster grass-roots support online in the past, and Sharpe is confident he’ll outshine the incumbent in this arena. “He is a dire soul when it comes to social media,"" he said, ""so I’ll beat him there for sure.”And he says he’ll handily beat the governor in any debates, asserting that Cuomo is ""not a very good debater.""When asked what he would do if he wins, Sharpe said he would make entities like the Board of Regents and Metropolitan Transportation Authority be more accountable, putting them under the authority of specific offices that would have to answer for any problems.Before he even gets on the ballot, however, he’ll have to win the Libertarian Party’s state convention in April, but doesn’t see this as a roadblock.“Assuming there’s no celebrity that jumps in and says, ‘I want to be on the ballot,’ the odds are very high I’ll be the nominee,” Sharpe said. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the main news event."	"The author discusses the 2018 New York gubernatorial election. The writer focuses on a candidate named Larry Sharpe. Sharpe, a Libertarian running against Cuomo, had the second-highest contribution by a wide margin raising $102,596 during the filing period, mainly from small donors online. For the past 19 statewide races, Democrats have won each election in New York state. Knowing this, Sharpe was confident that he would defeat his opponent because he chose to run with the Libertarian Party. ******13 of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees were confirmed as part of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's effort to reshape the nation's court for years to come. The article features Gov. Jay Inslee who states that Democratic senators aren't opposing the picks just so that they can go on recess. Marge Baker and Kristine Lucius stated that these judges will dismantle the civil rights hard-fought-over for the last six decades like reproductive rights, voting rights, LGBTQ equality, etc.******The Senate confirmed 13 of President Donald Trump's lifetime judicial nominations this week, quickly pushing through unqualified candidates hostile to a range of civil and human rights protections. Gov. Jay Inslee states that Democratic senators aren't opposing the picks just so that they can go on recess.******The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 13 out of President Donald Trump's 19 lifetime judicial nominees in a matter of days, and progressives are worried about the effect this will have on the country's future. Some of the confirmed judges have been criticized for not agreeing with Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 Supreme Court decision that ruled segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Gov. Jay Inslee stated that Democratic senators aren't opposing the picks just so that they can go on recess.******The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 13 of President Donald Trump's lifetime judicial nominees this week. The confirmations were done at breakneck speed in the last weeks before the Senate breaks following a voice vote with little opposition from Democrats. In mainstream media the news has been overshadowed by the 2020 Democratic presidential debates. Two of the candidates that have been confirmed would not say they agreed with the bedrock civil rights decision Brown v. Board of Education. The Progressives fear that the new judges will help to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality and shred the New Deal.******The New York State Senate has passed a law banning cyberbullying, however it lacks any definition of what constitutes cyberbullying. The author of the article feels that the law will inevitably be found unconstitutional due to its ambiguity. The article discusses the difficulties in defining what constitutes cyberbullying.******The New York Senate has attempted to criminalize cyberbullying but omitted a definition altogether. Any attempt to enforce such a law as written would most likely be unconstitutional, resulting in its demise. The law is purely cynical and designed to game the emotions of the electorate.******The New York Senate passed a new anti-cyberbullying law, but they failed to provide a definition of cyberbullying. They passed a version of the law, which was intended to be overruled on Constitutional grounds, as there was no way to define what cyberbullying is.******A 16-year old Parkland school shooting survivor, Kyle Kashuv, has emerged as a role model for young conservatives across the country after helping plan the largest-ever high school conservative conference.

"Passage: AVERIL CONSTANCE DEMUTH (1906–2000) was an English writer of children's stories, several of which have a fantasy element.LifeAveril Constance Demuth was born on 5 January 1906 in Devon.In the 1920s Demuth wrote words for music composed by Norman Demuth. However, her first story was _Trudi and Hansel_ (1938), set in the Austrian Tyrol. The girl Trudi, the boy Hansel, the cow Lotti, the dog Berni, the hen Griselda and the raven Kraak all go up the mountain to see Riese the giant, and then all come down again. Eleanor Farjeon gave the book a positive review: “Nora Lavrin's delicious crayon illustrations are the gay and unsophisticated complement to Averil Demuth's Tyrolean tale ... I like this book very much”.[1] A biographical sketch of Demuth appeared in the children's book club magazine _Young Wings_.[2] _The House in the Mountains_ (1940), illustrated by Grace Huxtable, was set in Kandergurgl, a little Swiss village.

"Passage: Hail Tenno!I’m here to talk nitty-gritty on a large systemic change that was discussed on Devstream 101: our upcoming changes to physical damage types and status procs.SETTING THE STAGE:Since Damage 2.0, physical damage has three types (Impact, Puncture and Slash, often referred to as IPS) brought to the forefront of Arsenals for modding and weapon diversity. There are also ten elemental damage types, consisting of four base elements (cold, electricity, heat and toxin) and the six combinations formed by modding two elements together. Each of these damage types is stronger or weaker against specific enemy types.However, each of these damage types also have “status effects” that can be applied based on a “procedural random chance” percentage, often known as procs. Impact procs cause enemies to stagger, Puncture procs reduce the enemy’s damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict “bleed” damage over time. Slash has long been considered the most powerful of these effects, primarily because Slash procs stack on top of one another and scale with weapon damage, while both Puncture and Impact procs could only have their flat effects refreshed.LEVELING THE FIELD:Those of you who watched our most recent Devstream will remember Khora, our next Warframe. Her powers allow players to switch between Impact, Puncture and Slash type modes, influencing the damage skew of her abilities. We saw this exciting new idea as an opportunity to revisit the various status proc types, and shake things up a bit!In an update coming soon, we will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. Our primary goal was improving Impact and Puncture; both of these procs will now _scale in effectiveness_, based on the damage dealt. An Impact proc with a small damage output (like a single Akstilletto bullet) will still only cause a short stagger, while an Impact proc with high damage output (like a Vulkar shot) can scale all the way up to a ragdoll, temporarily immobilizing them. In a similar manner, Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction, based on the damage dealt at the time of proc. Slash will continue working as it does now, stacking multiple status effects on top of one another.COVERING OUR BASES:Here’s where the math starts to get complicated - for all you stat-savvy Saryns and min-maxing Mesas out there, read on!Our more observant theorycrafters may see a flaw in the examples given above - these new damage-scaling procs would favour weapons that can output large damage amounts all at once, like snipers. In order to help rapid fire weapons compete in this regard, we are also making a systemic change to repeating procs: additional status effects will not “reproc”, but will instead additively increase the effectiveness of the existing proc. The upgraded proc is calculated using the damage total from the original proc and the new proc added together. For Puncture, this also refreshes the duration of the proc.We are also making a change in how a proc’s associated damage output is calculated - before, a Slash proc would scale based on the weapon’s total base damage output. Now, all procs will be calculated using ONLY the damage type of the proc that is being inflicted. Players may feel encouraged to focus their weapon builds around certain damage types in order to consistently inflict powerful procs, or go for raw damage across several damage types to inflict multiple procs at once!To help visualize how these changes will look, let's deep dive into the physical damage types to see how they play out in-game:IMPACT now serves as a great means of crowd control. Got a Corpus Tech threatening your excavator? Immobilize priority targets by unloading your Akstillettos, giving you more time to address the threat. Overwhelmed by an army of MOAs? Level entire rooms with something like a Strun!PUNCTURE can be used to minimize enemy lethality for frames with less survivability. Using high status puncture melees like Boltace or Endura, go blow-for-blow with Butchers and Powerfists without breaking a sweat. And if your Lex Prime can’t oneshot the Heavy Gunner rumbling towards your defense point, the enemy’s damage will be diminished long enough to safely deal the finishing blow.SLASH works the same as it ever did, stacking bleed damage over time to make short work of enemies. Your 100% status Tigris Prime will still eviscerate single targets with multiple procs, while something like a Galatine will still inflict more serious singular procs in a wider area - ‘tis but a scratch.FINAL INTENTIONS:It's important that everyone understands our goals and what led us to the above changes. When designing Khora, an Impact/Puncture/Slash based frame, we knew it was time to bring up Impact and Puncture to Slash competitive levels of desirability thanks to long-term feedback.

EDITED DECEMBER 19, 2017 BY [DE]REBECCA Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about the process of leveling the field?"	"The text's author says they were inspired by Khora, the next warframe and so something from the update will adjust physical damage in broad terms by changing the way impact and puncture damage affect enemy enemies. Adjustments will make impacts and punctures scale in effectiveness based on the damage of the weapon that causes it. The main improvement is that the percentages won't refresh but scale rather than hunt for additional percentage points.******Physical damage has three types, impact, puncture and slash, introduced to the forefront of arsenals for modding and weapon diversity. These damage types have their corresponding ""status effects"" which can be applied to the enemies. Status procs have a ""procedural random chance"" percentage, which is typically referred to as ""procs"". Status effects can cause an enemy to stagger, reducing damage output by a flat 30%, inflicted by the puncture proc or inflicting ""bleed"" damage over time, inflicted by the slash proc. Previous to the changes, both puncture and impact had no scaling while slash procs did stack. After the make adjustments, with impact, puncture and slash, they all can scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt.******A change is coming soon, where in Impact and Puncture status effects are reworked. Puncture can now be scaled from 10% damage reduction to 75% damage reduction, while Impact can be scaled from a short stagger to complete ragdoll. The change gives more credit to status inflict hybrids and encourages mods to play around damage types.******The game will be changing the damage two types (impacts/punctures) into damage scales that depend on total damage output. Some of the new math mechanics are explained with suggested uses. ******Physical damage has three types, impact, puncture and slash, introduced to the forefront of arsenals for modding and weapon diversity.

"Passage: I stood in the doorway and wondered if the door would close. It didn’t, the hinges had come off. I guess I didn’t know my own strength. The staircase was right in front of me now so I descended into the living room. No one was there, not even the dogs. This house is empty. My family left me, took off to someplace distant. I suppose they had gotten tired of me.I hadn’t had a job for months and my brain wasn’t working quite right. They noticed the lack of work but had no clue what was inside my head. They had left everything inside the house, all the furniture, the tv, the food, almost all of their belongings except what was necessary. It was torture. It was like they could walk in at any moment and say they had gone to the grocery store. But this was not the case, they were gone and weren’t coming back. It had been awhile since I’d seen them, no warning was issued. They had finally surprised me. I picked up the telephone and heard the empty space. When I tried to dial out it made animal noises instead of beeps. I got sick of it and plunked it back down. The electricity was still working but none of the objects that used it functioned correctly. The fridge was hot, the clock was lying, the lights made sounds; I flicked a switch and heard a man yell “get away!” The television only had one channel, and we had cable. Something was terribly wrong so I walked outside. The small car my family owned was still there but it did not have any wheels. I took a walk down the street and looked around the town I had always lived. My neighbor was shoveling the sidewalk, but as far as I could tell there was no snow.“What a storm, eh?” She huffed out as she scooped.I gave her a puzzled look and moved on. As I walked away I heard her say under her breath “What a friggin storm” As I moved along I walked past a small pizza place that had been on the corner forever. Only now it was not a pizza place, it was a clothing store titled ‘heaven’s little closet.” I looked in the window and all of the old employees were still there except now they had on fancy suits and were selling vintage clothing, not pizza. WEIRD, strange…this is just not right.A dog approached me and sniffed my boots. I scratched its ears and moved along once again. I got sick to my stomach and my eyes started to blur so I turned around and headed back towards my home. I  noticed a strong stench from outside of the house and as I walked inside it got worse. The hot fridge was melting all of the food inside into a boiling swamp of stink. I could hardly handle it. I looked inside and almost vomited, but I held my composure. Nothing in this town was right anymore, I don’t know if I had changed or if it was the whole place itself but I had always hated living here so maybe it was a sign to get to someplace new. I packed a small bag of clothing and some food that wasn’t in the rotting fridge and walked outside. I passed a small field of grass on my way and took the time to lie down. Grass hadn’t changed, it felt the very same. I must have fallen asleep because when I opened my eyes it had gotten somewhat darker. I grabbed my bag, which was now a different bag, blue instead of black, and headed toward the bus station. It was on the other side of the street from where I remembered it being. I got on and didn’t even look where it was going to. Goodbye. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about how the food in the fridge got so rotten, and why the narrator didn't notice this?"

My neighbor was shoveling the sidewalk, but as far as I could tell there was no snow.“What a storm, eh?” She huffed out as she scooped.I gave her a puzzled look and moved on. As I walked away I heard her say under her breath “What a friggin storm” As I moved along I walked past a small pizza place that had been on the corner forever. Only now it was not a pizza place, it was a clothing store titled ‘heaven’s little closet.” I looked in the window and all of the old employees were still there except now they had on fancy suits and were selling vintage clothing, not pizza. WEIRD, strange…this is just not right.A dog approached me and sniffed my boots. I scratched its ears and moved along once again. I got sick to my stomach and my eyes started to blur so I turned around and headed back towards my home. I  noticed a strong stench from outside of the house and as I walked inside it got worse. The hot fridge was melting all of the food inside into a boiling swamp of stink. I could hardly handle it. I looked inside and almost vomited, but I held my composure. Nothing in this town was right anymore, I don’t know if I had changed or if it was the whole place itself but I had always hated living here so maybe it was a sign to get to someplace new. I packed a small bag of clothing and some food that wasn’t in the rotting fridge and walked outside. I passed a small field of grass on my way and took the time to lie down. Grass hadn’t changed, it felt the very same. I must have fallen asleep because when I opened my eyes it had gotten somewhat darker. I grabbed my bag, which was now a different bag, blue instead of black, and headed toward the bus station. It was on the other side of the street from where I remembered it being. I got on and didn’t even look where it was going to. Goodbye.

"Passage: I stood in the doorway and wondered if the door would close. It didn’t, the hinges had come off. I guess I didn’t know my own strength. The staircase was right in front of me now so I descended into the living room. No one was there, not even the dogs. This house is empty. My family left me, took off to someplace distant. I suppose they had gotten tired of me.I hadn’t had a job for months and my brain wasn’t working quite right. They noticed the lack of work but had no clue what was inside my head. They had left everything inside the house, all the furniture, the tv, the food, almost all of their belongings except what was necessary. It was torture. It was like they could walk in at any moment and say they had gone to the grocery store. But this was not the case, they were gone and weren’t coming back. It had been awhile since I’d seen them, no warning was issued. They had finally surprised me. I picked up the telephone and heard the empty space. When I tried to dial out it made animal noises instead of beeps. I got sick of it and plunked it back down. The electricity was still working but none of the objects that used it functioned correctly. The fridge was hot, the clock was lying, the lights made sounds; I flicked a switch and heard a man yell “get away!” The television only had one channel, and we had cable.

"Passage: California conservatives have hit back at a proposed bill that would impose harsher sentences on people performing gay ‘cure’ therapy, saying that the bill would lead to a ban on the Bible.On April 18 the California Assembly voted to support harsher penalties for those performing gay conversion therapy in the state, opting to treat the treatment as a form of consumer fraud.Bill AB-2943, which was greenlit by state lawmakers on Wednesday, would build on the existing policies to introduce a possible conviction under state law for gay ‘cure’ practitioners.Performing gay cure therapy on minors is already is illegal in ten US states and counting, as well as Switzerland, Malta, Taiwan, two Canadian provinces, and the Australian state of Victoria.If enacted, California would join Illinois and Connecticut in explicitly making ‘conversion therapy’ subject to consumer protection laws.Gay ‘cure’ therapy has been widely debunked by multiple major medical organisations around the world.Travis Allen — a member of the California Assembly and Republican candidate for Governor — recently hit back at the state’s proposed bill, explicitly saying that it would ban the Bible in California.[]In an interview with conservative cable news channel One America News, Allen said: “According to how this law is written, yes, it would.”“This is, you know, PC culture, politically correct culture, gone horribly awry.“This is really directly hitting at our First Amendment rights as American citizens.”RELATED: REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER CLAIMS OUTLAWING GAY CURE THERAPY WOULD ALSO BAN JESUSThe interview quickly went viral, prompting conspiracy-debunking website Snopes to challenge the idea, rating it as “false.”Despite the lack of evidence for the claim that the anti-gay cure therapy bill would ban any religious texts, many other conservatives have hit out at the bill.[Gay Cure in the (Fort Worth Weekly]Wilhelm Joys Andersen)Anti-LGBT law group Alliance Defending Freedom, which has been at the forefront of the evangelical fight against gay sex, issued a memo March 8 stating that the bill was an attack on free speech.The memo reads: “At its core, AB 2943 outlaws speech, whether offered by a licensed counsellor, a best-selling author, or even a minister or religious leader.“It targets a specific message — that an adult who is experiencing unwanted same-sex attraction or gender identity confusion can find help to address those issues — for censorship.”Although the memo did not specifically say that the Bible itself would be threatened, it did state that bookshops would be banned from selling texts that “challenged gender identity ideology.”“A bookstore (including online bookstores like Amazon) could not sell many recently published books challenging gender identity ideology and advocating that these beliefs should be rejected by society,” said the Alliance Defending Freedom memo.RELATED: UK GOVERNMENT FINALLY PREPARING TO ‘END THE PRACTICE’ OF GAY AND TRANSGENDER CURE THERAPYThere is no part of the bill that would prevent the sale of religious texts or other books.The bill, submitted by out lawmaker Evan Low, would amend the section of the existing Civil Code section on fraud which deals with “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” – such as financial misrepresentation, false commercial claims and deliberate misselling to consumers – to include a prohibition on “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual”.On April 19 the bill passed by a vote of 50 to 18 and will now head to the California State Senate for consideration.[](Dr Christian Jessen investigated gay ‘cure’ therapy as part of the documentary “Cure me, I’m gay.” Photo: Channel 4)Evan Low, Chair of the LGBT Legislative Caucus, said: “Study after study has shown that ‘conversion therapy’ is ineffective, damaging, and counterproductive.“It is our duty to protect Californians from such deceptive practices that will expose them to physical and emotional harm.”HRC National Field Director Marty Rouse said: “Today, California legislators rightfully declared that so-called ‘conversion therapy’ is a complete sham and those who offer this deceptive and dangerous practice must be held accountable.“California was the first state to protect minors from being subjected to conversion therapy by state-licensed health care providers, and today’s vote is an important step to protecting all LGBTQ people from this debunked practice.“We thank the assembly members who voted in favour of AB 2943 and urge the Senate to swiftly advance the bill to Governor Jerry Brown’s desk.”[]Connecticut, California, Nevada, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Washington all have laws protecting youth from gay ‘cure’ therapy, while bills are pending in a string of other states. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize Travis Allen's opinions."	"Travis Allen, a member of the California Assembly and Republican candidate for Governor, claims that the law proposed by the California Assembly would ban the Bible in California. He says that the bill would violate First Amendment. "
"Passage: “Why do you want to know about the best day I ever had?”“I think it will help. To learn more.”“OK. I guess it was probably when I went sliding one day when I was ten years old. I had gone to school that day and came home but my mother wasn’t there. She had taken my little sister – who was five – to the doctor. My father wasn’t there ‘cause he was at work. Victor, the kid down the street, knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to go sliding. We lived in the woods and there were lots of hills in the back of Victor’s house. I put my boots and hat and gloves on and went into the basement to grab my plastic red sled. We walked to Victor’s house and went up the hill. Victor’s parents weren’t around. His father didn’t live there ‘cause he was always drunk and his mother was really old. I’m not sure where she was but she wasn’t home. So we were alone. There really weren’t any other houses around. We didn’t have nearby neighbors or anything. It was sunny out, I remember that really well. It was a little cold, but not too bad. I’d guess it was around 35 degrees. It was late winter, too. Probably early March. I’m sure of that because it didn’t get dark until at least 6. I usually got home from school at 2:45 so I’m positive we were sliding by 3. Anyway, Victor’s sled was a little more beat up than mine. Those red plastic sleds would crack and break so we’d have to repair them with electrical tape. That was really the only thing we had. Scotch tape didn’t work. But the electrical tape was better – most times it worked, but sometimes it didn’t. Yeah, so there were trees and a rock wall we had to contend with. The rock wall – maybe it was built by Indians? – was at the bottom of the hill. So what we’d have to do, we’d have to pack a lot of snow on the top of the boulders and make it into a jump. You wouldn’t want to hit the rocks head on after flying down the hill, trust me. The trees were tricky, but it could be done as long as you were careful. It was a real thin slice between two oaks about one-third down the hill. If you hit one of them you’d damage your sled and might not be able to make any more runs. You might also knock yourself out, so you had to aim for the center spot and once you made it through, it was a straight shot to the jump at the bottom. If you hit the jump just right, blasting up the snow ramp, you’d go airborne for about 10 feet. The key was making the ramp a gradual run. If you made it too steep, you’d fly up, not out. So, like I say, if you made the ramp as long as possible, you’d just crush it. For some reason, there really weren’t any trees past the rock wall so landing wasn’t a problem. The run-off was great, too. You’d crash down and just go until you stopped. Well, to wrap it up, me and Victor must’ve gone up and down that hill a hundred times that day. Just a pair of fourth-graders having a great time. No adults around, no punk kids, no wild animals (that we saw, anyway). When we got thirsty, which was every ten minutes, we’d grab some snow. Me and Victor just flying down that hill and hitting that jump, it was awesome. To get back to your question, though, I’m not sure why you even want to know this.”“Because of all the days in your life, you picked that one. You said that one was the best.”“Well, to me, it was the best.”“Why?""“Because we were little kids, just goofing around. We had no responsibilities, we were never bothered and we were doing something really fun.”“Have you had other fun times?”“Sure. But none like that.”“Why?”“I just told you.”“You said it was really fun. What made it more fun than any other experience you’ve had?”“It was…I don’t know. Maybe…because there was no way to be measured.”“Measured?”“Yeah, right. Measured.”“Measured in what way?”“Ah…measured in the way against others, obviously.”“I’m slightly confused.”“I drive a cab, OK? And a lot of my days I drop people off at these high-rises on the East Side. Incredibly beautiful buildings. I’m a faceless idiot to them, a cabbie who takes them from Point A to Point B to home. And most of the time I pull up to one of those joints, I wonder what it’s like inside because I’ve never been in one. I bet they have high ceilings and lots of space. But I wouldn’t know. See, I just think the real difference between someone in the front of the cab and someone in the back of the cab is luck. They were lucky, I was unlucky. And that’s it.”“What does that have to do with sliding on a winter day?”“Your questions are something else.”“I’m not trying to get you mad.”“I’m not mad. I’m attempting to answer and explain.”“Go ahead, then.”“When me and Victor were out there, everything was even. There was no way anyone could be better or worse than the next guy. It didn’t matter what clothes you had, or what boots you wore or what sled you used. We were out there doin’ it. Having fun. And there was no system of accounting that could quantify anything that went on during our time on the hill.”“Is there anything else?”“About that day? Not really. I mean, when we were airborne off that jump, soaring out over the snow, we were ecstatic. It was the best feeling in the world.” Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the primary source of tension in the story."	"The primary source of tension in the story is the question of why the narrator thinks the day they went sliding with Victor was the best day of their life that is posed by the narrator's passenger. The narrator explains that the day was so special because they were just a pair of fourth-graders having fun and there were no adults around. The narrator also explains that there was no way for anyone to be better or worse than the next guy. "

"Passage: ARTHUR MATTHEWS (1889–?) played for the New Zealand rugby league team in 1919 on their tour of Australia. He was Kiwi number 117.[1] He played in 3 tour matches but did not play in any tests as there were none played on this tour. He lived in Auckland and played for the Ponsonby United and North Shore Albions senior teams from 1915 to 1920.[2]Playing careerArthur Matthews began his career playing for Ponsonby United in the Auckland Rugby League competition. He played for them in the 1915 and 1916 seasons. He was an electrician by trade and in 1917 he volunteered for the war effort on March 16. After being physically examined he was declared fit for active duty though he never went away to fight.[3]He was involved in some controversy early in the 1917 season. He and his brother (W Matthews) turned out for the North Shore Albions without having formalised a transfer. Grafton Athletic protested and the Auckland Rugby League stood down both players and stated that the match should be replayed.[4] It was later reported that it was an oversight as W Matthews had just returned from war service and had played some matches for Ponsonby 3rd grade team years earlier, while the Ponsonby 3rd grade team had withdrawn from the competition due to a lack of playing numbers. As a result, the Ponsonby club had granted both brothers transfers.[5] The transfers were duly processed allowing Arthur Matthews to turn out for North Shore in their second round match against City Rovers.[6]In 1918 North Shore were forced to withdraw from the senior competition due to a lack of playing numbers. Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War. As a result, Matthews transferred back to the Ponsonby club where he played for the remainder of the season. He played for them in their Thacker Shield winning effort where they beat Sydenham in Christchurch 11–0 and scored a try .[7] In 1919 the North Shore team was revived and he returned to them. This was to be the most impressive season of Matthews career.In May 1919 he played in a trial match to make the New Zealand team. The match was played at Victoria Park and he was listed in the centres.[8] Subsequently, he was selected for the New Zealand team on their 1919 tour of Australia. He was named in the reserves to play for New Zealand[9] in a warm up match against Auckland but did not take the field.[10] Matthews played in 3 of the 11 tour matches, being used in 3 different positions. He debuted for New Zealand against Tamworth on June 11, playing in the centres. New Zealand won the match 21–13.[11] His next match was against Ipswich Firsts on June 26 where he played fullback in an 11–8 win. He kicked a goal and this was to be his only points for New Zealand.[12] His third match was against Rockhampton on July 9. This time he was to play in the halfback position and this was to be the last game he would play for New Zealand.[13] New Zealand would also win this match 23–0.Unusually Matthews did not represent Auckland until after he had played for New Zealand. Partly this was due to the fact that so few Auckland representative matches were played in previous seasons due to the war. He played for the “Rest of Auckland” team against the touring side on their return. Auckland was to lose 30–45 in front of 6,500 spectators at Victoria Park.[14] This was to be the only time he pulled on the Auckland jersey.In 1920 he again turned out for the North Shore team but at the end of the season on 8 September he was granted an open transfer by the Auckland Rugby League to play for any club outside the Auckland league district in their weekly meeting. It is unknown as to where he was moving to or if he played again.[15][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Why was Arthur Matthews a player of note?"	"He was selected for the New Zealand rugby league team on their tour of Australia in 1919.******For playing for the New Zealand rugby league (Kiwi) team and not playing test matches while on tour.******He was selected to the New Zealand team in 1919 on their 1919 tour of Australia and did not play any test matches."
"Passage: We owned the bottle the whole time we lived there, from the day we moved in. Nobody used it much; Devon and I have the basement to ourselves so we get our own fridge. He uses ketchup only with fries twice a month or so, while I myself am a Sriracha man. The thing most people don’t immediately realize when they move out of home is that the kitchen, a once magical and generous place that gratified you with instant food and satisfaction, on your own becomes a burdensome, dark and dingy room whose contents are always scarce and incompatible. Well, it was like that for us. We didn’t cook much, and we weren’t inclined to spend much time competing with the bugs for space in our cramped kitchen. We found out through the grapevine that our landlord was in fact a stubborn sort of miser who gutted, wired, and walled the house without any help. Help costs money to a man with no friends. In those slanted rooms we stood when we decided to thusly rename him slumlord.I clearly remember once being a more naive high school version of my self, dreaming of the day life granted me autonomy, as if that somehow includes the skills necessary to live on one’s own. Those days, I imagined credulously that I would teach myself to cook great things once I had my own place. But too soon into university did work and school brandish their heavy burdens. In the sparse moments of freedom and idleness, time was a ration; something to be used on preservation rather than sacrificed on expansion (although I did get a build a sweet aquarium over the year, but that’s another story). As a result, neither of us cooked so much as grazed. For a whole week I ate raw hot dogs and carrots before I forced myself to buy apples and soup. No kind of gourmet, organic, free-range food of any sort tastes better than the apple that ends the drought of raw hot dogs. The lonely contents of our fridge were primarily condiments and take-away meals. There were all the compliments and additions we needed for a meal, but no meal itself. We had every colour of paint, but no brush.One recurring disturbance that arose from the stochastic rearranging of our fridge’s contents  confused and frustrated me and Devon. Often without warrant, the kitchen door would refuse to stay shut. What seemed like a simple problem was mysteriously adamant. There was no resistance, no visible obstruction. No; this was a more subtle and cruel refusal, one that allowed the magnetic trim of the door to first kiss that of the refrigerator unit, then slowly pry the door away from its lover. The door would tease us by feigning closure, then mockingly swinging open.The fridge drove us insane. We took out the drawers and the shelfs and readjusted the magnetic strips. Nothing worked. For poor students, keeping food from waste was a priority. Expiry dates no longer counted; in poverty and squalor, one’s nose becomes the sole and executive arbiter of food safety. Keeping the fridge closed and cool was more important to us than any homework we did that year. But no matter what we tried, the fridge would recurrently, as if on it’s own volition, switch its magnetic strip to repel mode. For the longest time we had no idea why or how the fridge door would patently remain open. The fridge seemed to have a mind of its own and, to some degree, we respected it. Accepting the fridge’s perseverance, we would concede defeat by wedging the broom against the wall and the door in a rocky cease-fire between the fridge’s will and our own. It was one of the things that made me apt to spend a little more on the place I’m living next year.Nevertheless, for majority of the year the adamancy of the problem overcame us. It was not until later in second semester that my housemate figured out the cause. This happened on some otherwise unremarkable day in a week during which the fridge again decided to gape open. Excitedly, as one should when they solve some complex and demanding problem, he burst into my room. The width of his smile suggested that he won some sort of Nobel Prize. “Matt,” he managed, almost panting. “It was the ketchup.” Bemused, I followed Devon to the kitchen to witness his solution. Talking with a mixture of excitement and relief, he explained: “When the ketchup sits inside the door, it pushes the door away if it’s turned horizontally. We have to keep it parallel with the door,” he said, and enacted his description in order to exhibit the difference.What a marvel! I was beyond words. Such an easy solution to such a complex problem. It was certainly a relief, a simple fix to a pervasive and pestering issue. For the rest of the year, we lived in harmonious cohabitation with that fridge, albeit at the price of a few sour milk cartons and rotten oranges. However, throughout the constant reshuffling of cold cuts, hot dogs, cream cheese and yogurt, one item has been left unperturbed. The ketchup bottle, resilient and proud, stands proudly in claimed territory, a spot on the inside railing upon which it remains parallel to the door. It has earned the spot, through rigid victory over it’s supposed owners. It controlled harmony and restored balance to our kitchen on many occasions. It’s happiness controlled us. It was omnipotent. In the squalid darkness of our kitchen, we found a light in the Ketchup God, and we obeyed it. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the symbolism of food in this story."	"There are two kinds of food in this story: real food and condiments. The real food is the food that the characters use to satiate their hunger, such as the apples, carrots, hot dogs, and soup. The condiments are the ketchup and Sriracha, which are used to add flavor to the food."
"Passage: We owned the bottle the whole time we lived there, from the day we moved in. Nobody used it much; Devon and I have the basement to ourselves so we get our own fridge. He uses ketchup only with fries twice a month or so, while I myself am a Sriracha man.

"Passage: ""SQUIRE! Fetch me my horse! I’m going out hunting!""""Yes sire!"" Lousy, ungrateful, stupid bastard. Squire? Fucking squire? Jesus man you know my name, I’m Perry, like I tell you every fucking day. And don’t even get me started on the hunting. Hunting? Why don’t you just describe it accurately and call it seating your fat ass on the back of that poor sop of a horse and forcing it to canter round your shitty little forest, while you giggle with glee at the delightful experience of bouncing up and down. And all the while you’re accompanied by a large band of trumpeters, making absolutely sure every single animal with a brain has enough time to hear this ludicrous ensemble of idiocy, pack up its family, maybe have a small bite to eat and move the fuck away. Quite frankly, anything stupid enough to be caught by this moronic party had it coming. If the hunting party didn’t get them, an angry 6 year old with a small stick would’ve done the next morning. But I’ve side-tracked. The more important debate here is how the fuck this man managed to become a knight. I’d call him stupid but that would be an insult to uneducated peons everywhere. He is his own class of stupid, so far down the IQ scale he may have broken into previously unexplored realms of negative IQ. Oh, you think I’m being mean? Maybe a bit overdramatic? Oh no no no. Let me explain. This is the man who, when getting out of a double bed, rolled over the wrong way to the other side of the bed and, rather than realise his mistake and either rolling the other way to escape the bed, or continuing his roll to reach the other side, shouted desperately for help, for he had lost the floor and was surely doomed. This is the man who picked up a sword from the wrong end and failed to understand his mistake. This is the man who put a helmet on his foot and complained when he couldn’t walk properly. Please understand, my master is genuinely something else. I’ve yet to theorise how he became a knight. Oh yes, his father was a knight and that grants him an easy ride to the role, but I am amazed that, after discovering that his son had the intelligence of a melon, his dear father hadn’t pushed him to follow an alternative career path, something more appropriate to his level like, ooh I don’t know, an early grave. Too far? Perhaps. But you don’t have to serve under this infantile baboon. Every waking moment of my day is spent entertaining his every want and need, and oh boy does he have a lot of needs. Sometimes – and I wish I was joking – he struggles with wiping his own ass. Guess who gets that fantastic job? That’s right, Squire Perry, his faithful fucking assistant. Other highlights include: serving him his food; helping him eat his food; cleaning his food when he spills it on the floor, like the clumsy halfwit he is; cleaning his bed; cleaning his clothes; organising his equipment. Oh, and how could I forget, fetching his fucking horse when he wants to go on a fucking hunting expedition.I should go, he might cry if he doesn’t get his bloody horse soon. Ooh, that is a tempting prospect... but no. It wouldn’t be obeying my fucking duty. I swear to fucking god. Pray for me, would you?  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the excerpt say about the stupidity of squire Perry's knight?"	"The knight is lousy and ungrateful, and he doesn't even know his squire's name. He is also stupid enough that he doesn't know which end of the sword to use, and he has trouble putting on his helmet. He also needs a lot of help with basic tasks, and it's the job of the squire to provide them.******In the excerpt, the narrator, Squire Perry, explains that he is this knight's assistant, doing tasks that the knight is unable to do. The knight is so stupid, he once got in a freak accident because he was unable to figure out how to exit a bed. This is the man who put a helmet on his foot and complained when he couldn’t walk properly."
"Passage: **Beware this is my beginning of a long story a plan to write about a hypothetical serial killer, and this passage is morbid.** Also this is a very rough draft so excuse spelling mistakes or the overuse of contractions.  There were always rumors of a serial killer so evil, so demented, so monstrous, so gruesome, and so evil that he was looked at as more of the hypothetical monster under humanities bed than a real psychopath that needs to be hunted down and exposed. In this short story I am going to describe the infamous and horrible tale of what can be only called as “the monstrosity.” The monstrosity was born in 1945, his exact date of birth is unknown, he was born in Midwestern America; most likely Kansas. His father was a hulk of a man who conceived him when he brutally raped his own daughter, the violence in the monster’s life began before he was even born. His mother lets call her Lesly was only seventeen years old when she gave birth to the monstrosity, who was born about three weeks premature. Lesly almost died in childbirth because the monster’s father (lets call him Larry) continued to beat her during the pregnancy which led to the premature and extremely painful birth. The doctors predicted the monstrosity would not live through the night...oh how wrong they were; looking back if the doctors knew of the evil they allowed to enter the world, they may have had no problem suffocating that small innocent child right there and then. The monstrosity had no serious health problems from the violent birth, except for the fact that he would never grow taller than 5'5 even as a grown man; this monster’s height comes into play later and can be looked at as a curse or a blessing depending on how you read this evil’s story. The monster’s father Larry remarried shortly after he was born, he lied to all about the real mother of the monster. Being a minor still Lesly was forced to continue to live with Larry and his new wife Marie even after all the abuse and pain he had caused her, she wouldn't run away because she felt her son deserved a real mother not a life of lies. So, for the next three-years she worked hard at her job as a waitress to save enough money to move out of the abusive home with her son and get her own place. The abuse of Lesly continued throughout these years but Larry didn’t touch his son the monster because he respected the fact that his son had a keen likeness to himself, and resented the fact that his own daughter Lesly wanted to turn his own child against him. Larry wasn't a sociopath but he was a monster by his own merit, he didn't understand why his daughter hated him and thought he was a useless excuse for a men let alone a father; even though he sexually and physically abused her after her mother passed away from cancer when Lesly was about nine-years old. Larry tried to turn the monster who was about four years old by this point against his true mother Lesly and make him love his wife Marie and him as parents. Now, for a moment let us observe what know about Larry’s second wife Marie...she was about twenty-six years old married to Larry a much older man and little is known about her background or early-life. What we do know however straight from the words of our little monster is that she was an extremely beautiful woman; about 5’9, luscious blond hair, long legs, a nice curvy midsection, and most of all her skin according to the monster was softer than any other woman he ever met. But that all comes in to play later in this story of true evil. I will set the scene for the beginnings of our little monster’s first look at death and real cruelty. Of course the monster was exposed to the beatings of his real mother Lesly from time to time, but Marie did her best to keep the monster away from such things. You may be thinking why would a woman as beautiful as I described Marie as be with a violent man like Larry and allow him to abuse his adult daughter? Well, since little is known about Marie’s personality (at this point in time) I guess we can just say love works in mysterious ways and in this case ends up intertwined with death and unknowingly creating pure evil. Anyway, back to the story...Lesly finally saved up enough money to take the monster away from this hateful environment and get her own nice place. But Larry and Marie didn’t like that idea, they didn’t believe that Lesly really worked for that money and accused her of prostituting herself to make the money. They called her all sorts of names, not knowing that our little monster was hiding under the bed in his mother’s room just taking all this in. Like I said he had witnessed violence before, but never had he witnessed such abuse in a verbal sense they broke his mother down. Lesly wasn't the most emotionally sound woman due to her father’s abuse and it didn't take much to break her, and by the end of the verbal abuse from Marie and Larry which went on for almost an hour she just sat in the corner wet with her own tears and ashamed that she allowed them to do that to her. Then something happened to Lesly as she set there wallowing in her own pain and self-hate...she snapped. This young woman who received awful abuse by her own father her whole life finally snapped. She hated him with such passion, who was he to abuse her and then coddle her son like he was a decent human being when he was the one who raped her and almost killed her from beatings during her pregnancy! Lesly was not a small woman, her father Larry was about 6’6 and 250-pounds and he passed those genes onto his daughter; she was 6’3 but her weight was unknown. She grabbed Larry’s baseball bat that he used to occasionally use to beat her when he wasn't playing on the local softball team with it, and she waited in the room until she heard Marie go into her room and fall asleep. She left her room, and shortly after the monster (without her knowledge) followed her into the hallway and watched her. She saw that Larry was passed out on the couch and she snuck up behind him, only his head was exposed from under the covers. Lesly raised the bat above her head and slammed it back down with all the might and power she had within her body. The sound of Larry’s skull cracking was sickening to the soul of a normal person...you could hear the skull break apart into small fragments and slice through the brain matter. You could taste the blood in the air and feel the lack of Larry’s existence within it. Even though our monster was only four or five years old, he describes the event with such vivid remembrance as if it was his first memory. And maybe it was, because in my opinion this moment and what happened next is what creates our little monster as he really is or will be for the rest of his so called life. Larry was near dead after the first blow, but Lesly didn't know that and probably felt more powerful and in control than she ever had before in her entire life. She kept hitting him over and over, she destroyed his face so completely that it would take a ton of work for the cops to identify his body without just assuming. The monster describes hearing the life leave Larry’s body but instead of like it is in film he described it as just a silence within the room as if Larry’s soul or whatever made him alive had just been removed from the area. The silence as he described it was quieter than anything he would experience for a long time after. Than the silence was broken by Lesly yelling at the monster “go to your room, you shouldn't see this baby.” Her voice wasn't the same though it sounded different than the mother the monster though he knew, it sounded emptier as if the love Lesly held for him had exited her. And even at five years old the monster says that he felt the difference.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What terrible scene did the monster see that impacted his whole life?"	"His mother Lasly killed his father Larry."

The silence as he described it was quieter than anything he would experience for a long time after. Than the silence was broken by Lesly yelling at the monster “go to your room, you shouldn't see this baby.” Her voice wasn't the same though it sounded different than the mother the monster though he knew, it sounded emptier as if the love Lesly held for him had exited her. And even at five years old the monster says that he felt the difference.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Would Larry come back as ghost and control the monster to be the monster the text describes?"	"No answer."
"Passage: Taking a deep breath, Daniel turned the knob. He walked into the room trying to assess his surroundings quickly while still maintaining his composure. The room was medium sized. Guards flanked the doors and lined the walls. The table in the center contained a machine, placed in front of its terrified operator, and wires leading towards--Daniel heard the door lock behind him, sealing him in with that ... _thing_. The creature lay in the center of the room, its presence consuming and demanding. It did nothing to warrant this attention, it lacked even the slightest hint of movement, yet it commanded the attention of every human. Daniel approached the table.His steps reverberated throughout the room, cleaving the silence.Each step brought discomfort.Daniel hid is unease.He wore his face like a mask.But, his eyes tore the room apart instinctively, looking for separation.Yet, he continued forward.Daniel closed the distance between him and the thing until he was close enough to look down upon it.He dragged the chair back. There was a sigh of relief in the room as the sound put an end to the silence. The guards readjusted their weapons; the operator began to fiddle with his equipment; and the thing … rippled. Perhaps it was a welcoming-- Daniel sneered, or a challenge. Daniel looked at the operator who continued to nervously fiddle with his equipment in a transfixed manner.Daniel quickly lifted his briefcase onto the table, unconsciously determined to keep the silence at bay. The briefcase opened with a satisfying click. He spread the pages across his end of the table. He hadn’t even had time to read up on the literature before he was rushed here, so he slowly began to rustle through the documents one by one.In one of the dossiers, Daniel saw pictures of the thing taken a few hours ago when it had first arrived. It looked ... different. Daniel dared a glance at the thing. It was duller now, more opaque, than it was in the photos. Its “flaps” and “fins” drooped, and its entire body looked like it was being compressed and squashed against the table. It reminded him of melted ice cream. Daniel’s stomach churned and he looked back down towards the reports. He only scanned the next fifty pages. In total, the reports said nothing about it in thousands of words. It was an enigma and unlike anything else.  He was the first. He had his shot before even the scientists could get their hands on it. He didn’t know whether to feel honored or terrified. Daniel noticed a slight noise coming from the receiver on the table. Grimacing, Daniel picked up the receiver and placed it in his ear. He disliked this but it was “standard” procedure.“What do you think you’re doing?” a voice demanded.Daniel did not recognize the voice but it was filled with an arrogance that enraged him. Daniel turned his steely gaze towards one of the cameras.“I assume you’d like me to know what it is exactly that I’m doing sir.

If you turned on a light would they scatter…?“Crystal,” said Daniel.He slid his papers away, clearing the field. He looked back at the thing’s side. It seemed even duller than the last time he had looked but he couldn’t be sure. Daniel nodded to the operator and received a shaky thumbs-up.They were good to go. “Why are you here?” Daniel inquired.The machine began to beep as the operator quickly worked on deciphering each letter into dots and dashes. Finally the operator slumped back into his seat. He fidgeted with items near him to occupy himself until it answered--if it answered.Daniel felt the hairs on his neck rise and tasted ozone. There was a sharp crack as the operator dropped his pencil. Daniel looked around to see that the guards had raised their weapons slightly and the operator was stiff with his eyes staring straight out, staring slightly past the thing, like a deer caught in headlights. They sensed it too. The machine began to hiss with static. Then the voices began, like several people speaking at once, not fighting for air but sharing it.“We are here as messengers,” the voices said.Then the bureaucrats began. It started with disconcerted mumbling occasionally loud enough to be transmitted and then broke out into yelling and arguments. Daniel rubbed his temples. They were already at each other’s throats. Doing his best to ignore the receiver, Daniel glanced around the room admiring the unflinching guards. They held their weapons with a trained ease, confident in the superiority they provided. But in such a case as this, could they really be sure?“What do you mean by “we?” Daniel said.“Those who stand before you and those we represent.”The thing’s--perhaps things’-- antennae gave a lazy dismissive flick. Could it really be multiple creatures?“What are you?”“There is no auditory representation of us. You may choose your own.”“How many of you are here?”“Just us.” The thing began to ripple more erratically. “We do not have time for this.”Daniel leaned forward, “What is your message?”“End all emission of electrical signals--immediately.”The noise from the receiver broke into a roar. The bureaucrats knew exactly what was at stake. Economies would be crippled. Society and development would be flung decades back. Preventing a few people out of seven billion from using electrical signals is infeasible. Most importantly, even if it were possible, reelection after implementing such a procedure would not be.“You want us to turn off all our wireless transmissions?”The creature … expanded. “Yes.”“We cannot.” Even with the continuous yelling, the humans listening in seemed to agree on this much. Daniel waited for the operator to transmit his message. He was slow in doing so, and his actions and responses were slurred like a man in daze.Before the operator had transmitted the message, the static hissed from the machine again, causing the operator to nearly leap backwards into the arms of one of the guards.“Why?!”Daniel nearly flinched. His heartbeat quickened and he had to forcefully pace himself. In an effort to mask his unease he nonchalantly motioned for someone to bring him water. Daniel turned his impassive face towards the thing again with renewed hostility.  “We do not trust you.” He heard the bureaucrats murmur an agreement--the stars must have been aligned. The fins rippled and groups of voices took turns to speak, “Your emissions are a beacon, a beacon that could lead them to us or yourselves. They are close.

"Passage: In a sun-drenched, sticky, tourist infected corner of Orlando, FL rests a Whole Foods Market. It was strategically planted within a few miles of Disney property in the hope we'd see our share of the tourist economy. That's where I work as a customer service supervisor. It's a very transient place. The tourists, our team members, upper management, everyone is always arriving or departing. We have a permenent Uber lane. There are little grab and go shampoos and shaving creams at every register. A whole section of our store is dedicated to hotel-related items. We even sell sandwiches in adorable, airplane shaped boxes. Every customer you meet is heading home soon and all the employees will tell you they're ""forming an exit plan"". You'll work with a guy for 6 months and one day he's vanished. The next thing you hear is a Facebook notification - ""Loading up the car for Portland, wish me luck Orlando!"" As a result it can be easy to stop concerning yourself with the everyday details of those around you, even co-workers you see ten or twenty times a day. No one sticks around here. Case in point, this Asian chick whose been working behind the Juice Bar for somewhere between 4 months to a year, I can never tell. It just so happens most of my day is spent in a customer service booth directly across from this Bar. At that distance, maybe 50 feet, we'd exchange simple gestures - a glance here or nod there. I can tell you very little about her. She's maybe 5'3 with Dark Brown, chin length hair pinned up into a crayola orange beanie and covered neck to knees in an over-sized, white chefs coat. That's about it. One of the few other things I'd noticed was a handwritten name tag reading, ""Bok Choy"" in black permenent marker. I'll mention that this isn't so strange a thing to see on a name tag at Whole Foods Market. We have a store manager whom we regard as ""Juice"" because he's a 6'9 hipster with a bright orange Slayer beard. On any given day his name tag might say ""Juice"", ""The Juice"" or ""Juiced"". There's also a few hippies from the holistic team who renamed themselves after their astrological sign. A person's name tag can say literally anything here. This day I decided to order a Juice, which is unusual for me. Approaching the register, I say, a bit loudly, ""Hey, Bok Choy, what's up?"". A cold stare came back in my direction. ""My name is Melanie. Seriously, Jason? I'm wearing a name tag and everything."" I put a stupid look on my face and pointed at her chest. As I'm dropping my finger arrogantly towards the tag it finally hits me - the tag says ""Favorite Vegetable"". Not name, but ""Favorite Vegetable"". The real one, it turns out, was attached to her beanie. Instead of stopping here, as would be prudent, I did as I often do and talked myself into a worse place. ""But you can see where that's confusing for me, right Melanie? I'm over there, you're over here. That's a name tag from 50 feet away. I have basically no vantage point on your beanie. Your head is obstructed by the wheatgrass grinder."" Now she starts laying on the sarcasm. ""But it says Bok Choy AND Favorite Vegetable, dude."" The font is nearly the same size on both.""""But it's a name tag in the spot where normal people pin name tags! I'm not responsible for checking whether it, just this once, also says Favorite Vegetable.""""It's green"", she says. ""The name tag is green and has a little cauliflower head sticking out of the top of it. Did you also not notice those two things?"" ""I was thinking the Produce team just got cool, custom ones. Listen, people get nick names around here, ya know?"" ""And so you thought they nicknamed the new Asian girl Bok Choy and put it on her name tag?"" I ordered my juice. It was a Bombay Sunrise - OJ, Turmeric and Ginger. Needless to say, She took a few ""liberties"" with the recipe and I nearly spit fire. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about the narrator's relationship with Melanie?"	"Melanie works behind the juice bar, and the narrator works across her in the customer service booth. The two see each other on occasion. Melanie occasionally exchanges gestures (glances and nods) with the narrator. The narrator never spoke to her for almost a year before one day they went to order a juice. ******Melanie works behind the juice bar, and the narrator works across her in the customer service booth.

"Passage: HERMANN HESS HELFENSTEIN (February 3, 1916 - October 14, 2008) was a Swiss Naturalist, Explorer, Climber and Engineer too. He was member of the “Schweizer Alpen Club” (SAC in Switzerland) and “Deutscher Anden Verein” (DAV in Chile). He was notable for first ascents and exploration in Patagonia.Career as naturalist, explorer and climberHe was born in Engelberg, a mountain village in Switzerland, where his`parents ran a hotel. He began climbing with his father who was also a mountain guide.[First Climbing Titlis North Face in Engelberg Swirtzerland in 1935 by H. Hess, W. Hoehn and O. Bolli]In 1937, he emigrated to South America and in the South Andes Mountain Range he first climbed the Volcano Puntiagudo[1] with his partner R. Roth through the South Face.[2]Hermann Hess led three expeditions to Northern Patagonian Ice Field. Two of them were for geological purposes, started from the east and was sponsored by the Swiss Geologist A. Heim. The expedition from 1939/12/15 to 1940/1/16 was integrated by H. Hess, A. Heim, W. Schmitt, H. Moser and H. Neumayer.[3] and the expedition from 1945/11/18 to 1945/12/31 was integrated by H.Hess, A. Heim, H. Smoll, A. Valmitjana and J. Studer. There he gave unknown and nameless summits a denomination, such as Cerro Cristal and Cerro Tronco climbing them for the first time.[4][Kayaking for the approach to Northern Patagonian Ice Field during the Geological Expedition from 1939 to 1940]Hermann Hess led and sponsored a 5-month expedition[5] to the Northern Patagonian Ice Field from 1941/11/1 to 1942/3/1 starting at this time from the west with E. Hoffmann, J. Alig, G. Mani and the porter I. Vargas finding severe climatical and geographical difficulties.[6][7] In that decade he made also the successful first climb with R. Eggmann and J. Neumeyer to isolated Cerro Maca in 1944.[8][H. Hess, U. Lorber and H. Stehr climbing the main summit of Mount Tronador (3491 m) in 1963]Return to SwitzerlandIn 1950 he married Frida Schwabe in Puerto Varas. They had two children, German and Roland and in 1960 he returned to Switzerland. There he climbed the Mont Blanc, Weisshorn, Matterhorn, Eiger and Piz Palü.He returned to Santiago, Capital of Chile, in 1963 and undertook the higher summits of the North Andes Mountain Range with members of DAV W.

"Passage: Champagne, chardonnay and second-rate vodka. The descent into Vanity Heights was a perfect contradiction. Darcy’s den was full of promises. The promises of allure, freedom, revelry. The promises of power and powder, regret, addiction. But the promise that Vanity Heights fulfilled best was not Darcy’s own. It was the promise flashed upon the television, upon the computer screen, canonised on the glossed pages of magazines. The expectations of how teenager life should be; the expectations, up until this night, crushed by education and responsibility. This was the promise that led Darcy’s guests down the stairs. Down the stairs into Vanity Heights. The house had transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room, when she arrived. “Celeste!” he exclaimed, prancing over to her, a stick of addiction in one hand and a glass of hobby in the other. She gave a long hug, a short conversation and an expected question. With a customary smile, Darcy gave to her an expected bottle of answer. The party raved on, yet the revelry was muted by the brick wall that barricaded Celeste from the action. The rhythmic dripping of the basin tap was the only music Celeste had, yet she chose to reapply her face instead of dancing. She wanted to dance, though, and she knew Darcy would be waiting for her, so she rushed through her routine. She clasped onto her 50mL glass friend, already thrice-used, even though she had been in the bathroom only five minutes.         The drink was downed within seconds of being poured; the liquid sunk to her stomach. She could feel the warm tendrils, cooing words of friendship, branching through her chest, her stomach and finally, finally, back up to drown her mind; pulling her further from the world and closer to her weekend friends.         Six doses later, to finish the bottle, and she was ready to join them. No one ever really knew why she was there. Good school, great grades, aspirations of business and law. Nevertheless, she was soon jiving and twisting and dropping on the floor, with Darcy and other men: around them and in their laps; their hands hoping to get in hers.  Her beholder lay seemingly dormant in her stomach; though its dark tendrils were tightening, strengthening their grip on Celeste, controlling her like a puppet with tangled strings. She thought the overseer a friend, a protector, but her body knew better.Celeste mapped her escape as soon as she felt it. Up the stairs, out of Vanity Heights, past the kitchen, into the garden bed just by the backdoor. She pushed through the crowd. Darcy saw her leave; he knew why, but he didn’t follow.  He never did. By the time she reached the stairs, the beast had revealed itself. A kraken, furious as red, limbs thrashing about inside of her, fighting desperately for an escape. Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. ‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.Whilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  ‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. The stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. ‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. ‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about Celeste's relationship with the drugs and alcohol she took?"	"She was just having a little to drink and would stop after tonight. However, her body had other plans for her. It was already too late.******Celeste has a love-hate affair with drugs and alcohol, more like frenemies or a symbiotic relationship where the substances give her the courage to dance with her weekend friends, only to leave her system violently the moment she feels drunk.

"Passage: ""SQUIRE! Fetch me my horse! I’m going out hunting!""""Yes sire!"" Lousy, ungrateful, stupid bastard. Squire? Fucking squire? Jesus man you know my name, I’m Perry, like I tell you every fucking day. And don’t even get me started on the hunting. Hunting? Why don’t you just describe it accurately and call it seating your fat ass on the back of that poor sop of a horse and forcing it to canter round your shitty little forest, while you giggle with glee at the delightful experience of bouncing up and down. And all the while you’re accompanied by a large band of trumpeters, making absolutely sure every single animal with a brain has enough time to hear this ludicrous ensemble of idiocy, pack up its family, maybe have a small bite to eat and move the fuck away. Quite frankly, anything stupid enough to be caught by this moronic party had it coming. If the hunting party didn’t get them, an angry 6 year old with a small stick would’ve done the next morning. But I’ve side-tracked. The more important debate here is how the fuck this man managed to become a knight. I’d call him stupid but that would be an insult to uneducated peons everywhere. He is his own class of stupid, so far down the IQ scale he may have broken into previously unexplored realms of negative IQ. Oh, you think I’m being mean? Maybe a bit overdramatic? Oh no no no. Let me explain. This is the man who, when getting out of a double bed, rolled over the wrong way to the other side of the bed and, rather than realise his mistake and either rolling the other way to escape the bed, or continuing his roll to reach the other side, shouted desperately for help, for he had lost the floor and was surely doomed. This is the man who picked up a sword from the wrong end and failed to understand his mistake. This is the man who put a helmet on his foot and complained when he couldn’t walk properly. Please understand, my master is genuinely something else. I’ve yet to theorise how he became a knight. Oh yes, his father was a knight and that grants him an easy ride to the role, but I am amazed that, after discovering that his son had the intelligence of a melon, his dear father hadn’t pushed him to follow an alternative career path, something more appropriate to his level like, ooh I don’t know, an early grave. Too far? Perhaps. But you don’t have to serve under this infantile baboon. Every waking moment of my day is spent entertaining his every want and need, and oh boy does he have a lot of needs. Sometimes – and I wish I was joking – he struggles with wiping his own ass. Guess who gets that fantastic job? That’s right, Squire Perry, his faithful fucking assistant. Other highlights include: serving him his food; helping him eat his food; cleaning his food when he spills it on the floor, like the clumsy halfwit he is; cleaning his bed; cleaning his clothes; organising his equipment. Oh, and how could I forget, fetching his fucking horse when he wants to go on a fucking hunting expedition.I should go, he might cry if he doesn’t get his bloody horse soon. Ooh, that is a tempting prospect... but no. It wouldn’t be obeying my fucking duty. I swear to fucking god. Pray for me, would you?  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Describe a backstory for Squire Perry in 3-5 sentences based on character and context clues."	"Squire Perry is a servant to a knight. He is frustrated with his master's incompetence and stupidity. He is also frustrated with the fact that he has to do whatever his master wants, even when it is stupid and unnecessary."
"Passage: FERNANDO ALFONSO YZNAGA DEL VALLE (October 16, 1850 – March 6, 1901) was a Cuban American banker who was one of the best-known men of New York and foreign society and club life. Described as “one of the most entertaining of men, very clever at epigram and repartee, and famous for quaint sayings. His life had been adventurous and, from a domestic point of view, somewhat of a stormy nature.”[1]Early lifeYznaga was born in New York on October 16, 1850. He was the oldest of four children, and only son, born to merchant diplomat Antonio Modesto Yznaga del Valle (1823–1892) and Ellen Maria (née Clements) Yznaga (1833–1908).[2] His father was from an old Cuban family who owned a large plantation (Torre Iznaga)[3] and sugar mills in the vicinity of Trinidad, Cuba; they had connections to several Spanish aristocratic families.[4] In addition to plantations in Cuba and Louisiana, his parents owned properties in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island. Among his siblings was Consuelo Yznaga (who married George Montagu, 8th Duke of Manchester in 1876)[5] Naticia Yznaga (who married Sir John Lister-Kaye, 3rd Baronet in 1881),[6] and Emily Yznaga (who never married).[7][8]His maternal grandfather, Samuel Clements, was a steamboat captain who owned Ravenswood Place, a plantation in Concordia Parish, Louisiana, which his mother inherited upon their death.[9] Through his sister Consuelo, he was uncle to William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester and two nieces, known as May and Nell, who both died of consumption before marrying.[10] He was with his sister in Davos when her youngest daughter, Lady Alice (Nell), died. Reportedly, he “never seemed a very strong man since then,” and it was said that “his constitution had never recovered from the long, nervous strain which he went through at that time.”[11]He was graduated from the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard,[12] before returning south and earning an LL.D. degree from Louisiana Law School while at his families plantation near Lake Concordia in Louisiana, where they were all well known in New Orleans society.[13]CareerAfter his eldest sister's marriage to the Duke of Manchester, he came to New York City.[14] After his first marriage to a sister-in-law of William Kissam Vanderbilt, he was reportedly gifted a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and entered the firm of H. B. Hollins & Co. at 15 Wall Street, a close friend of Vanderbilt's and J. Pierpont Morgan. Yznaga was “an excelled businessman” and made his fortune at the firm, working there for twenty years until his death in 1901.[15] The firm, which was organized in 1878, went bankrupt on November 13, 1913.[16]Even after his divorce from Jennie, he remained close friends with Vanderbilt and was frequently aboard his yacht, the _Valiant_. Yznaga, Vanderbilt and Winfield Hoyt were referred to as the “Three Vanderbilt Musketeers” as they were always seen together.[17] He was a member of the Union Club, the Tuxedo Club, the County Club, the Manhattan Club, the Athletic Club, the Meadow Brook Hunt Club, and one of the original members of the Metropolitan Club in 1891, where he lived.[18][19]Personal life[Mrs. Fernando Yznaga, née Miss Mabel Wright, of New York, .] On September 22, 1880, Yznaga was married to Mobile, Alabama born Mary Virginia “Jennie” Smith (1856–1926), sister of Alva (née Smith) Vanderbilt at the Vanderbilt home in Oakdale on Long Island.[20] They were daughters of Murray Forbes Smith, a commission merchant, and Phoebe Ann (née Desha) Smith (daughter of US Representative Robert Desha).[21] After their divorce in 1886, Jennie remarried to William George Tiffany of Baltimore (a nephew of Mrs. August Belmont and first cousin of Charles Lewis Tiffany)[22] in 1888 and moved to Maisons-Laffitte near Paris (before their eventual divorce in 1903).[23][24]Fernando's engagement to Mabel Elizabeth Wright (1869–1926)[25] was announced in what was described as an astonishment to society. At the time, she was living with her father, a designer of carpets for Higgins Mills, in a boarding house and “her face was her fortune.” The wedding took place a week later on March 4, 1890 at the boarding house and they set sail for Europe the following day. Upon their return, they lived in New York and at Tuxedo Park. Mabel later went to South Dakota where she divorced Fernando in 1895 and,[26] soon after, married the Hungarian Count Bela Zichy (nephew of Mihály Zichy) and became the mother of Count Theodore Zichy.[27] There were rumors of his engagement to be married a third time, including to Constance Biddle a few weeks before his death, but they were all denied.Yznaga died of diphtheria at the Minturn Hospital in New York City on March 6, 1901.[28] After a funeral at the Little Church Around The Corner, he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.[29] Upon his death, his estate worth about $2,000,000,[30] was left primarily to his sister, then the Dowager Duchess of Manchester.[31][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Patterson, Jerry E. _The Vanderbilts._, pages 120-121. New York: H.N. Abrams, 1989.[22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about Fernando Yznaga's career?"	"Yznaga was a banker. He was gifted a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and entered the firm of H. B. Hollins & Co. at 15 Wall Street. He was an excellent businessman and made his fortune at the firm. He worked there for twenty years until his death in 1901. The firm went bankrupt in 1913."
"Passage: I stare down at my arm. It’s so pale and unblemished. I slowly lift up my razor blade. I can feel it’s cold anticipation, ready to tear my skin apart, which is exactly what it’s going to do. I drag it across my flesh in a long slow drag. I watch as the warm crimson spreads. My arm, my clothes, -nothing remains dry. Why do I do this to myself? I keep saying that I’m going to stop.Suddenly there is a knock at my door. I panic. I wrap a dirty cloth around my arm and run into the hotel closet. “Get out here right now you little bitch.” I can already tell who it is from their voice. My drug dealer. As I’m crouching in the closet I try to slow my breathing, but my heart jumps when the door is kicked in. There’s a tiny hole in the closet door, and I lean forward to put my eye to it. I can see he’s brought company. They’ve moved into another area of my hotel room, possibly the kitchen. I close my eyes as I strain to hear them, but by the time I open my eyes I’m too late. I feel a searing hot rod force its way into the back of my skull. I can’t stop screaming, and that attracts the rest of the men.I have no choice but to obey. I come out of the closet quietly while they tie me up.  I try to remain calm, but I falter as the boss begins to talk. “Guess what Sabrina? I woke up today and I found all my drugs and money gone. You’re the last person I’ve sold to in days. What did you do with them?I have no idea what he’s talking about. He’s probably high right now. But then I suddenly remember something. The razor blade on my bed. At the current moment they have me tied up, lying face down on the floor. I look up at him and use my most innocent voice. “I didn’t do it, but I know who did. But right now I’m a little uncomfortable. You can keep me tied up, but please let me lie down on the bed. ““Why should I care if you’re comfortable or not?”“Because otherwise I’m going to say a thing.”“I guess I’ll just have to beat it outta ya.”I smile a cocky grin. “You already poked out one of my eyes and I haven’t said anything yet.” I hear him curse under his breath as he throws me onto the bed.  Within seconds I find the razor blade and start to cut at the rope that imprisons me. I’m done quickly and he doesn’t even notice. “Quite stalling and tell me something already.”“Oh, I’ll tell you something.”“what’s that?”“you’re going to die.”I throw my razor, quick and sleek, and watch as his red crimson spills out. His goonies have seen enough, and bolt for the door.  They think they’re going to get away, but they’re not. I grab the two closest things on the end table next to my bed, a pen and a vase. I sprint out my door and quickly catch them in the parking garage. The first assailant makes the mistake of turning around to look at me, and I smash the vase into his face, sending a million shards of glass into his eyes, flesh, and even mouth. I grab a piece before it hits the ground and I kill him like I did his boss, by slicing his throat. This whole time his buddy has just been standing there, watching me kill him. Once his friend is done it’s only me and him, and he has my full attention. I take my pen and jab it into his right eye, just like the one that got damaged on my own face less than five minutes ago. I quickly pluck the pen back out and sink it into his heart, and let his body drop. I don’t care about the mess, let the staff clean it up. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about Sabrina's relationship with the man that enters her hotel room?"	"The man is Sabrina's drug dealer who has come to interrogate her about his missing money and drugs.******Sabrina has a drug addiction.

Whenever something needs to be done I see him doing it. He doesn’t just sit around; I’ve actually seen him go into the mines. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m a child but not even the adults in the village are as active as him.       He’s always leaving the kingdom and coming back with tons of different things. I can’t always see what he’s coming back with, but I’ve seen bones, some kind of meat that just looks bad, and even strange looking pearls. And the dogs! He has so many dogs that there’s not a single wild dog here. He must be traveling great distances to find all these dogs, because I know they’re not from here. When I see him doing all these strange things I start asking my parents what it is he’s doing, and they tell me: “don’t question the king,” but they never tell me why. He doesn’t look old, so he can’t be all that wise. All that work he does and all the times he leaves - it’s not normal.  I was  sick of wondering.I finally got into his castle and he was at his workbench. When I got closer he looked back at me, seemingly confused, but he turned back around and kept tinkering with some weird red dust. I got closer and mustered up the courage to ask him as politely as I could, “How come you’re so different than everyone else?” The king stopped, stood up and looked at me. He asked, “Excuse me?” and I said it again. He chuckled briefly under his breath and said “it seems like you’re different too.”       He started to tell me a story. “When I was your age, I lived in a different kingdom and I felt the same way about my king. I would go to school and all the kids and the teachers would seem to just drift through their lives, but not the king; he was always spontaneous. I was finally sick of that curious feeling, so I went and talked to my king and he told me his story. Sometime afterwards the kingdom was destroyed and all the people inside were attacked by monsters. It was terrible. There were explosions, arrows, and the groans of the undead. I was able to escape, but barely. I fought my way out with nothing but my hands. finally I found a break in the chaos and I found a cave and covered the entrance with dirt. I was devastated, but I wanted to live so I built a shelter.  I enjoyed building. Then since I had built my shelter I began mining - I enjoyed that as well. I had so many supplies I decided to build more and I ended up building a village. Strangely enough people appeared. That village moved on to become this kingdom. That’s my story.”I asked him why he told me all that. and he told me simply because I was a player. A player? I was so confused. He then told me that only players are kings. I didn’t understand. He went on by asking me what my earliest memory is and I told him standing outside. “Exactly,” He said. “That was the first time you entered this world.” He started talking about how this life isn’t real and that once he’s gone he’ll be able to enter the real world again.He began taking me adventuring with him, that’s when he would explain things and share his knowledge with me. “When a king dies, everything he ever did goes with him. That’s how my king’s old kingdom was destroyed. I left my Kingdom and made a village. I have people of my own now. My king was killed by a mob of three suicide creatures right outside his gate.

Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the passage say about the relationship between the narrator and the king?"	"The narrator is curious about the king and always witnessed him doing a lot of strange things. He is amazed by the king's travels and how he collects animals for his stronghold. The narrator finally goes to him to ask about why he does all things he does and how he is different from others. The king tells the narrator about his past and how he once was like the narrator. His previous kingdom was destroyed, and he went on to create the village and kingdom that the narrator lives in currently. ******The narrator is curious about what the king does. They know that the king doesn't interact with other people very often because she hasn't seen him give anyone orders or instructions. One day, their curiosity leads her to sneak into the king's castle, and after having walked around for a while and have seen many interesting things, they muster up the courage to ask the king what he's doing. The king says it's his job to take care of the kingdom, and it comes to a point where he has to go and adventure with them. He says that a king has to take care of his people until the end of their time. After sharing childhood memories, he shares his own story about being a king, discovering where he was and how he found a village to call home. He tells them how important their first day is because that is their first day within their new kingdom. They still have a lot of adventuring to do together.******In childhood, the king looked like an ordinary villager, but was very active and usually took off for parts unknown. It became very clear to the narrator that the king was very different from all the adults because of his behavior and questions that would be raised by it. The narrator wanted to ask the king why he seemed so different and that was when the king told him a story involving himself and a different kingdom, saying that they weren’t real people. After coming to this conclusion, the narrator affirmed the friendship and relationship that he had with the king by going with him on adventures.******In childhood, the king looked like an ordinary villager, but was very active and usually took off for parts unknown.

"Passage: LAZARUS NKALA (26 February 1927 – 3 December 1975), known in political circles by the nickname UMAVAVA,[1] was a Rhodesian trade union leader, activist, and revolutionary. Born in Filabusi in Matabeleland, he attended mission and government schools and trained as a builder. He worked in Bulawayo, and became a union leader and African nationalist activist. In the 1950s and 60s, he served in leadership roles in the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, National Democratic Party, and Zimbabwe African People's Union. He was detained in 1964 and, with the exception of a three-week period the following year, was held in continuous detention for the next ten years. Upon his release in 1974, he was named Organising Secretary of the ANC, and attended the Victoria Falls Conference as part of Joshua Nkomo's delegation. He died shortly after in an automobile accident driving from Salisbury (now Harare) to Bulawayo.Early lifeNkala was born on 26 February 1927 in Filabusi, Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia.[2][3][4] He comes from a large Ndebele family; one of his siblings, Enos, also became active in the independence movement and later served in parliament and as a cabinet minister.[5] His father, Madika Nkala, was a peasant farmer, teacher at the local Methodist mission school, and later a cobbler.[6][7][8] His mother, Mbase Moyo, was a lay preacher of the American-led Brethren in Christ Church.[9] Nkala was raised in the Brethren faith and attended primary school Nkankezi School and at the Church's Matopo Mission.[10][11] He went on to study at Mzingwane High School in Essexvale (now Esigodini), where he became exposed to politics through fellow students, including Jason Moyo and others.[12][13] There, he received elementary industrial instruction, trained as a bricklayer, and qualified as a builder in 1947.[14][15]Career and political activityNkala worked in Bulawayo as a builder for many years.[16] In 1950, he was elected chairman of the Bulawayo branch of the African Artisans' Union.[17] He was elected president of the union in 1956, an office he held until his arrest in 1964.[18] He also served for some time as president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region.[19] He was also appointed Chairman of the Barbourfields Tenants' Association and member of the Bulawayo African Townships Advisory Board.[20]In 1957, Nkala joined the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, led by Joshua Nkomo, and served as treasurer for the organisation's Bulawayo branch until it was banned in 1959.[21] He was a prominent figure in the African nationalist movement in Bulawayo, and was briefly detained after a state of emergency was declared by the colonial government in February 1959.[22][23] He served as treasurer for the Bulawayo branch of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Nkomo's new party, from 1960 to 1961, when it, too, was banned.[24] From 1961 to 1963, Nkala was the Bulawayo district chairman for the NDP's successor, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU).[25] In 1962, ZAPU was banned, and the next year, some of its members broke away and formed Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's organisation, while his brother Enos joined ZANU.[26][27] From 1963 to 1964, he served as National Organising Secretary of the People's Caretaker Council, a newly-founded successor organisation to ZAPU that was the same in all but name.[28][29]On 23 April 1964, Nkala was detained by the Rhodesian government, and with the exception of a three-week period in April/May 1965, he remained in restriction or detention for over ten years.[30] He was initially held at Gonakudzingwa restriction camp, but because of his strong influence on the morale of his fellow restrictees, was moved, along with Nkomo and Joseph Msika, to Camp 5, a more isolated location.[31] There for four years, he had little human contact besides Nkomo and Msika, and began taking correspondence courses.[32] He passed his A Levels and went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in political science and public administration from the University of South Africa.[33][34] He was released on 3 December 1974.[35]In December 1974, Nkala was named to the Central Committee of the African National Council (ANC), and attended the Victoria Falls Conference in August 1975 along with Nkomo as part of the ANC delegation.[36][37] When the ANC split internally in September 1975, Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's faction, and was named organising secretary at the party's congress, held in Salisbury (now Harare) on 26 and 27 September 1975.[38]Death and legacyAround 2:30 p.m., 3 December 1975, exactly one year after his release from detention, Nkala was killed on the Salisbury-Bulawayo Road near Bembezi when his car overturned.[39][40][41][42] The ANC colleague he was traveling with, Aggrippah Moyo, was also killed.[43] A joint funeral held for Nkala and Moyo in Bulawayo was attended by thousands.[44][45] Joshua Nkomo spoke at the burial, stating that Nkala's and Moyo's death would not be in vain, and that Zimbabweans would achieve the independence the two died while fighting for.[46] Nkala left behind a widow and five children.[47] He was buried at Pelandaba Cemetery in Bulawayo, and was declared a national hero after independence in 1980.[48] In November 2019, 1st Avenue in Bulawayo was renamed Lazarus Nkala Avenue.[49][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize everything before 1960."

He died shortly after in an automobile accident driving from Salisbury (now Harare) to Bulawayo.Early lifeNkala was born on 26 February 1927 in Filabusi, Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia.[2][3][4] He comes from a large Ndebele family; one of his siblings, Enos, also became active in the independence movement and later served in parliament and as a cabinet minister.[5] His father, Madika Nkala, was a peasant farmer, teacher at the local Methodist mission school, and later a cobbler.[6][7][8] His mother, Mbase Moyo, was a lay preacher of the American-led Brethren in Christ Church.[9] Nkala was raised in the Brethren faith and attended primary school Nkankezi School and at the Church's Matopo Mission.[10][11] He went on to study at Mzingwane High School in Essexvale (now Esigodini), where he became exposed to politics through fellow students, including Jason Moyo and others.[12][13] There, he received elementary industrial instruction, trained as a bricklayer, and qualified as a builder in 1947.[14][15]Career and political activityNkala worked in Bulawayo as a builder for many years.[16] In 1950, he was elected chairman of the Bulawayo branch of the African Artisans' Union.[17] He was elected president of the union in 1956, an office he held until his arrest in 1964.[18] He also served for some time as president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region.[19] He was also appointed Chairman of the Barbourfields Tenants' Association and member of the Bulawayo African Townships Advisory Board.[20]In 1957, Nkala joined the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, led by Joshua Nkomo, and served as treasurer for the organisation's Bulawayo branch until it was banned in 1959.[21] He was a prominent figure in the African nationalist movement in Bulawayo, and was briefly detained after a state of emergency was declared by the colonial government in February 1959.[22][23] He served as treasurer for the Bulawayo branch of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Nkomo's new party, from 1960 to 1961, when it, too, was banned.[24] From 1961 to 1963, Nkala was the Bulawayo district chairman for the NDP's successor, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU).[25] In 1962, ZAPU was banned, and the next year, some of its members broke away and formed Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's organisation, while his brother Enos joined ZANU.[26][27] From 1963 to 1964, he served as National Organising Secretary of the People's Caretaker Council, a newly-founded successor organisation to ZAPU that was the same in all but name.[28][29]On 23 April 1964, Nkala was detained by the Rhodesian government, and with the exception of a three-week period in April/May 1965, he remained in restriction or detention for over ten years.[30] He was initially held at Gonakudzingwa restriction camp, but because of his strong influence on the morale of his fellow restrictees, was moved, along with Nkomo and Joseph Msika, to Camp 5, a more isolated location.[31] There for four years, he had little human contact besides Nkomo and Msika, and began taking correspondence courses.[32] He passed his A Levels and went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in political science and public administration from the University of South Africa.[33][34] He was released on 3 December 1974.[35]In December 1974, Nkala was named to the Central Committee of the African National Council (ANC), and attended the Victoria Falls Conference in August 1975 along with Nkomo as part of the ANC delegation.[36][37] When the ANC split internally in September 1975, Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's faction, and was named organising secretary at the party's congress, held in Salisbury (now Harare) on 26 and 27 September 1975.[38]Death and legacyAround 2:30 p.m., 3 December 1975, exactly one year after his release from detention, Nkala was killed on the Salisbury-Bulawayo Road near Bembezi when his car overturned.[39][40][41][42] The ANC colleague he was traveling with, Aggrippah Moyo, was also killed.[43] A joint funeral held for Nkala and Moyo in Bulawayo was attended by thousands.[44][45] Joshua Nkomo spoke at the burial, stating that Nkala's and Moyo's death would not be in vain, and that Zimbabweans would achieve the independence the two died while fighting for.[46] Nkala left behind a widow and five children.[47] He was buried at Pelandaba Cemetery in Bulawayo, and was declared a national hero after independence in 1980.[48] In November 2019, 1st Avenue in Bulawayo was renamed Lazarus Nkala Avenue.[49][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize everything related to Nkala's family."

"Passage:  Devyn wrapped her arms tightly around her sister’s arm while staring fearfully at the man. She pulled her sister back to try to hide her from him  but he was already staring at the two of them with narrowed eyes. “That’s the guy who murdered that group of people! They couldn’t find evidence that found him guilty but everyone knows he did it!” She rambled on quickly while tugging on her sister’s arm who was only staring at the man curiously.  “Really? I didn’t know,” she said while tilting her head.  Her sister glared fiercely at her. “How could you not know?! It was all over the news!” She yelled before squealing and pulling her sister forcefully causing Rachel to spill some of her drink. “He’s coming this way!”Josh and Sana raised an eyebrow from the scene Devyn was creating before they followed Rachel’s gaze.Josh smirked and stood up but Sana scooted all the way to the wall of the building with fear in her eyes. “There you are! Where have you been?” Josh slung an arm around the man’s shoulder who was glaring down at Rachel as she began to eat some of the mozzarella sticks nonchalantly. “Ladies, this is my best friend Pierce. You probably already know who he is.”“We’ve met before,” Rachel spoke up as she looked up at the two men. “I didn’t know who he was at the time.”  “That would explain why you aren’t scared,” Josh snickered and Pierced visibly tensed up; his jaw clenching and he sent a glare at Rachel who was only staring at him with curiosity.  “How are you not scared?” Devyn exclaimed looking at Josh with disbelief before squeaking and hiding behind her sister when Pierce merely look at her.   Josh began to noogie Pierce’s hair that was style in a long black ponytail, grinning widely as he did. “I’ve known him since he was little! He wouldn’t do such a thing!”Sana and Devyn stared at the two in disbelief while Rachel stared at her drink with content before a looming figure rose up behind the two men.“You two.” The looming figure growled in a low voice as Demie slammed both of their heads together forcefully. “How many times have I told you two to stop terrorizing my new customers?” He picked them up by the collars of their jackets and glared at them with fire in his eyes.   “I wasn’t doin’ anything to them!” Josh argued back but with one glance from the bartender he swallowed his voice.   “The girl didn’t order a drink the when i first took their orders.”  Josh gave him a shaky smile as he began to sweat nervously, stammering over his words as he tried to explain the situation but Demie was already looking at Pierce. “You need to stop making them fear for their lives, so behave yourself or I’m kicking you out,” he threatened and Pierce averted his gaze from him while nodding.   Demie dropped the two on the floor without a care before looking at the girls with a kind smile who were staring at him with a mixture of relief and fear. “As long as I’m here they won’t do anything to you. Here or outside of the bar.” He looked to Sana who had been watching Josh as he sat on the ground still shaking. “Would you like a new drink?” She looked from the drink to Josh who was slowly standing up and rubbing the sore spot on his butt. She didn’t feel dizzy or sick, so at least he was respectable.“No, I’m fine.” She gave him a smile and he nodded.   “If you need anything else, including getting rid of these two, just come up to the bar,” he offered before leaving them to themselves.   Josh cursed quietly as he slowly sat back down in his seat while Pierce dusted himself off, still standing by the booth instead of sitting or leaving. “He doesn’t have to be so rough,” Josh grumbled as he fixed his leather jacket.   “It seems like you two cause a lot of trouble,” Sana causing Josh to smirk and give her wink making her roll her eyes. “I am trouble.”   Pierce continued to stare at Rachel who was still eating. His stare was making Devyn’s skin crawl so much she could not bare it any longer. “Can you move? I need to use the bathroom,” Devyn tapped Rachel on the shoulder and she nodded, standing up beside Pierce who was watching her like a hawk. Devyn quickly left the booth and rushed to the bathroom before Rachel looked at Pierce unafraid.  “Do you wan to sit with us?”  “I’m leaving,” he said shortly before walking towards the door despite Josh’s protests. He left the bar, letting the door slam loudly yet no one else in the bar seemed to notice or care except for Demie who did not want the glass to break.   “Was it something I said?” Rachel asked Josh as she sat back down but he shook his head and shrugged.   “I don’t know, but I should go after him.” He stood up and went to leave before looking back at Sana with a smirk to which she sent him an questioning look. “I don’t have a phone number anymore since I gave you mine. Can I have yours?”She stared at him deadpanned, looking unamused on the outside but laughing happily at the cheesy pickup line on the inside. “Fine.” She gave him her phone number and he placed the napkin in his pocket before flashing her fingers guns with a wide grin. “I’ll see you around Dollface.” He winked before leaving the bar quickly and leaving the two girls by themselves.“He doesn’t seem that bad,” Rachel smiled at Sana who bit her lip to stop herself from smiling.   “I just hope i don’t regret giving him my number.” Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about Pierce?"	"Pierce is the best friend of Josh. He is a tall man with a long black ponytail. Pierce is a suspected murderer, but the authorities couldn't find any evidence. Josh says he wouldn't do such a thing.

"Passage: Washington D.C. — In November 2015, the Free Thought Project reported that Mikhail Lesin, the former head of media affairs for the Russian government, and the founder of Russia Today (RT), was found dead in the hotel room that he was staying at in Washington DC.Originally, authorities announced that Lesin died from a heart attack. However, the results of his autopsy released months later indicated a far more sinister cause of death and the heavily redacted FBI documents that were just released add to that story.The documents, detailing the FBI investigation into Lesin’s death were just released Saturday morning in spite of the investigation ending in October of 2016.In spite of the original cause of death noted as a heart attack, a few months later, the District of Colombia’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and Metropolitan Police Department said that “blunt force injuries of the neck, torso, upper extremities and lower extremities” contributed to Lesin’s death. “The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has released the cause and manner of death for Mikhail Lesin… Cause of Death: blunt force injuries of the head,” the statement said.Now, FBI investigators have released the results of their investigation claiming that the blunt force trauma all over his body was self-inflicted.“Mr. Lesin died as a result of blunt for injuries to his head, with contributing causes being blunt force injuries of the neck, torso, upper extremities, and lower extremities, which were induced by falls, with acute ethanol intoxication,” the report states.In other words, the FBI is claiming that Lesin got so drunk that he repeatedly and violently fell on things until he killed himself.To show just how much information the FBI is willing to release on these findings, here is the version of the amended autopsy report they released in the report.[RT][rt]Essentially, all other information in regards to the findings of Lesin’s death has been scrubbed from the documents as the remaining pages are almost entirely redacted.Not only did the US remain tight-lipped on the investigation but they also refused to allow Russian authorities to cooperate.As RT reports, back in 2016, months before the closing of the case, Moscow said it was expecting Washington to explain why Russia had not received any details from the probe into Lesin’s death, despite repeated requests._“We are awaiting the related clarifications from Washington and the official data on the progress of the investigation,”_ Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a Facebook post at that time. She added that if the media reports citing the forensic statement are confirmed, Russia will send an official request to the US_ “for international legal assistance.”_In October 2016, the US authorities announced that Lesin died of natural causes and closed the case. _“Based on the evidence, including video footage and witness interviews, Mr. Lesin entered his hotel room on the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2015, after days of excessive consumption of alcohol and sustained the injuries that resulted in his death while alone in his hotel room,”_ the US attorney for the District of Columbia said in a statement.Lesin’s death came at a time where he was surrounded by controversy, especially in the US. RT, the Russian-based news source that Lesin founded has become very controversial in the US—ostensibly for the fake Russiagate scandal—but in reality, for challenging the western narrative of foreign policy and privacy issues. Some US politicians have suggested that RT be banned in the US for “spreading propaganda,” while others have been blatant enough to attack Lesin personally.According to the NY Times, until late 2014 Lesin ran the media wing of the state’s energy giant, Gazprom, before stepping down or, more likely, being forced out. He ended up in the United States, where he and his family owned properties in Los Angeles said to be worth far more than the salary of the former government minister.Some US Senators, including Roger Wicker of Mississippi, had called for the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Lesin’s finances prior to his death.Wicker was concerned that Lesin made too much money, something that was really none of his business.“That a Russian public servant could have amassed the considerable funds required to acquire and maintain these assets in Europe and the United States raises serious questions,” Wicker said.The original announcement of the heart attack back in November 2015 makes this case all the more ominous considering the fact that the medical examiner’s office also said Lesin’s body had blunt force trauma to the neck, torso, arms and legs too. How did authorities overlook his wounds?As RT reports, Lesin was considered one of the most influential figures in the Russian media landscape. A graduate of Moscow State University with a degree in Civil Engineering, he served as Minister of Press and Mass Media from 1999 to 2004. He was also a presidential media adviser from 2004 to 2009. Lesin became chief executive officer at Garprom-Media in 2013 and remained in the position until early 2015.Sponsored Content:[] Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Why is it hard for critics to accept that Mikhail Lesin killed himself?"	"The FBI claims Lesin was so drunk that he repeatedly and violently fell on things until he killed himself. He had blunt force trauma injuries all over his body. This is unlikely to be an accident."
"Passage: Perched on a steel beast of war, I pondered my own existence. A sergeant in the army, with a caring family and spouse, medals to my name and a desire to live. But how far did it go? How far can I run before I fall, and there is nobody there to pick me up? I wanted my memories to last forever. Lively, energetic, spirited: The men I commanded were my bread and butter. Valiantly serving under my order for 3 years prior to Operation Neptune, we held our lives in our rifles. I sat with them on our steel beast, waiting to be unloaded with the other men.

Curled up amongst each other, ignorance of bliss, we stood shoulder by shoulder like lambs to the slaughter.Dainty fingers dawdled on the triggers. Who was he? Who was he to take a life? Only the grateful had the heart to pull, and fire.Eyes plunged backwards, body lurched forward. Crumpled to their knees. Fell to the trenches, writhing in the dirt, men howled in fits of pain.Let the deceased roam the realms they no longer wanted to exist.Waves trickled onto our clothes, soaking us from the inside out. The storm rose above our mortal toil; Mother Nature has no patience. Salty sea air tempted our nostrils of home and valour, but it did little to front the horrors on the beach. Gunfire ablaze, our Kraken approached the beachhead. This is true war. Fear, anger, pride, camaraderie, pain: a will to survive. Lead continued to find its way towards my men, but I convinced myself they could never hit me. Hot, piercing metal seared its way through the earth, which may as well have stood still, striking our position with brute inaccuracy. Inside the sudden silence, my superior barked those damn dreaded words.I was told there was artillery inbound. No reinforcements. 30 seconds was all we had.Mortar seemingly erupted from the crust, taking my men with it into the air. 3 of my men were taken in the first blast. They had aimed that one for my squad. These weren’t the first men to die with me, and certainly won’t be the last. More explosives inbound, and no clear way to escape. It didn’t look hopeless, just fatal. Another 2 fell down, injured, which is another pair of notches on my watch.

My men must have assumed I’d been hit, I didn’t see them again.It seemed like I was floating gracefully for an eternity, and in my frenzy, I reasoned that I was hated by those I loved, and regrets filled my soul. It wasn’t death that did this; it waswar. I also reasoned that these would be my final emotions, my final tribute, to this earth, and I should cherish them. How would I know when I died? It faded to black long before I fell to my watery grave.In my absence of consciousness, I was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline, picking up survivors and POW’s alike. It appeared I was alive, and the luckiest one in the squad, according to those Brits.

"The narrator can be described as a keen and careful sergeant in the army with a caring family, who sacrifices his wellbeing as well as that of his men for the greater good. He is valiant and resourceful, and he is committed to his men, commanding their lives in the shells of their rifles. He is conflicted by the fact that he unwillingly leads the men, who stand shoulder by shoulder to the slaughter. He also admires his foe, the Germans, for their bravery and tenacity. The narrator is also confident that he will not die with the Germans because he is a lucky man. His spirit dwindles as the Germans begin unleashing massive weaponry and his fellows are being killed left and right. In the end, he falls into the water, where he is saved by the British soldiers.******The narrator of the story is a sergeant in the army. He leads a team of men.

On rainy days, he instead goes to a cafe to sit down, because it's better to be outside. The narrator doesn't seem to have many friends.******The narrator is a writer. One day, they spot a woman reading at a park they regularly visit. Every day they keep an eye on her, knowing that one day they should talk. The narrator fantasizes about asking her out.

The man never sees the woman again.******The narrator seems lonely. He goes to the park every day just to stare at a girl he had no intention of saying hi to, which means he's also a little creepy. He was weird because he would laugh whenever the girl dropped something (like he knows her or is in on a joke) and get disappointed whenever he lost sight of her.

"Passage: Perched on a steel beast of war, I pondered my own existence. A sergeant in the army, with a caring family and spouse, medals to my name and a desire to live. But how far did it go? How far can I run before I fall, and there is nobody there to pick me up? I wanted my memories to last forever. Lively, energetic, spirited: The men I commanded were my bread and butter. Valiantly serving under my order for 3 years prior to Operation Neptune, we held our lives in our rifles. I sat with them on our steel beast, waiting to be unloaded with the other men. How long did we have?Huddled into a vehicle reminiscent to the Kraken himself, I became lost in thought. This strange plan, these peculiar men. Curled up amongst each other, ignorance of bliss, we stood shoulder by shoulder like lambs to the slaughter.Dainty fingers dawdled on the triggers. Who was he? Who was he to take a life? Only the grateful had the heart to pull, and fire.Eyes plunged backwards, body lurched forward. Crumpled to their knees. Fell to the trenches, writhing in the dirt, men howled in fits of pain.Let the deceased roam the realms they no longer wanted to exist.Waves trickled onto our clothes, soaking us from the inside out. The storm rose above our mortal toil; Mother Nature has no patience. Salty sea air tempted our nostrils of home and valour, but it did little to front the horrors on the beach. Gunfire ablaze, our Kraken approached the beachhead. This is true war. Fear, anger, pride, camaraderie, pain: a will to survive. Lead continued to find its way towards my men, but I convinced myself they could never hit me. Hot, piercing metal seared its way through the earth, which may as well have stood still, striking our position with brute inaccuracy. Inside the sudden silence, my superior barked those damn dreaded words.I was told there was artillery inbound. No reinforcements. 30 seconds was all we had.Mortar seemingly erupted from the crust, taking my men with it into the air. 3 of my men were taken in the first blast. They had aimed that one for my squad. These weren’t the first men to die with me, and certainly won’t be the last. More explosives inbound, and no clear way to escape. It didn’t look hopeless, just fatal. Another 2 fell down, injured, which is another pair of notches on my watch. The squad was starting to break down into fragments, and no longer sure who made it out, we tried to hide, run and fight.Us, a ragtag group of soldiers, versus an entire German platoon. It was at this point we had all agreed to never be captured alive. We held our position over the lagoon, keeping our ground with joyful valence in the darkest hour. I took a step backwards, and promptly fell into the water. My men must have assumed I’d been hit, I didn’t see them again.It seemed like I was floating gracefully for an eternity, and in my frenzy, I reasoned that I was hated by those I loved, and regrets filled my soul. It wasn’t death that did this; it waswar. I also reasoned that these would be my final emotions, my final tribute, to this earth, and I should cherish them. How would I know when I died? It faded to black long before I fell to my watery grave.In my absence of consciousness, I was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline, picking up survivors and POW’s alike. It appeared I was alive, and the luckiest one in the squad, according to those Brits. They would never be able to comprehend what I saw, and what I lost.“It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those whoare willing to endure pain with patience.”- Julius Caesar(Any and all constructive criticism greatly recommended) Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about the sergeant's squad?"	"The sergeant's squad comprised of mostly men he had commanded for a few years. They were of a pleasant disposition and could find value light in anything. Since the sergeant cared for his men, his heart screams pain when their lives were destroyed in the battlefield. When the sergeant fell into the water, the squad assumed their commanding officer had been hit and continued fighting. It appears that everyone in the squad died because the sergeant was said to be the luckiest one in the squad for having lived through it. ******The sergeant's squad appears to be a courageous group of soldiers who are willing to endure both pain and hardship in order to survive and triumph over insurmountable odds. The group seems to possess a camaraderie and unity that makes them stronger as a whole despite facing harsh trials and obstacles such as mortar, gunfire, and artillery. Overall, they exemplify valor and courage in the face of great adversity. When the sergeant fell into the water, the squad assumed their commanding officer had been hit and continued fighting. It appears that everyone in the squad died because the sergeant was said to be the luckiest one in the squad for having lived through it. ******The sergeant's squad is a used to be a lively, merry bunch of soldiers but in the storm risen from the ocean, the sergeant lost his platoon. There are not many of them left, and the opportunity for reunion is bleak for the rest. ******The sergeant's squad was made up of brave and determined soldiers who did their best to survive even in the most hopeless and difficult of circumstances. Despite being outnumbered, outgunned and out of options, the soldiers nonetheless put up a fight. When the sergeant fell into the water, the squad assumed their commanding officer had been hit and continued fighting. It appears that everyone in the squad died because the sergeant was said to be the luckiest one in the squad for having lived through it. "
"Passage: Mauricio Pochettino fears that English football’s tendency towards over-analysis, and its fixation on minor issues like diving, is slowly “killing the game”. Speaking after Dele Alli was booked for simulation in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday - his third such offence in as many seasons - Pochettino voiced his belief that the general mood of moral panic within the game, over what he described as “minimal details”, risks stifling football’s natural expression.Pochettino also reserved harsh judgement for the use of video technology, saying that human refereeing errors were an intrinsic part of the game. Likewise, he argued that simulation on the pitch, while an offence rightly punishable under the laws of the game, was simply a sporting tactic rather than anything more sinister, insisting: “Football is about trying to trick your opponent.”The Tottenham manager has admitted in the past that during his playing days at Newell’s Old Boys and Estudiantes, diving to win a penalty from the referee was regarded as a skill, one even practised in training. And Pochettino’s distaste for English moralising is underpinned by the fact that it was his leg over which Michael Owen dived during the 2002 World Cup, ultimately sending England through to the knockout stages at Argentina’s expense.Doubtless Pochettino will be accused in some quarters of giving divers a free pass. Yet equally, he deserves a good deal of credit for trying to convey a nuanced, intelligent sentiment in a language that is not his first. He agreed that Alli’s dive merited a booking, although he denied that Alli was beginning to develop a bad reputation amongst referees. But it was the froth and furore that followed which he found most baffling.“Look, it was a yellow card,” he said. “It happens. The referee was right. During different games, a lot of situations like this happen. The problem now is that we are so sensitive about the situation, and then we are so focused on Dele Alli. It’s too much sometimes. There is such a focus on this type of situation. I think it’s a minimal issue.“Look, there are a lot of positives from Dele. Of course, he's not perfect. Nobody is perfect. Of course, he is a clever boy. He is a little bit nasty. The problem is that, more than this type of situation, I am worried we are going to change the game that we know.”Mauricio Pochettino has stressed that commentators shouldn't be overly fixated on Dele Alli's diving antics (Getty)Whereupon the discussion abruptly opened out into broader themes: into the media, into English exceptionalism, into the very essence of the game. “Football is a creative sport,” he said, “in which you need the talent that grows in a very intelligent person, a very smart brain. And now we are so focused on minimal details. I am worried that in a few years, we are pushing the sport we love now - a passionate sport that people love to watch around the world - into a very rigid structure.

Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize what the text says about diving/dives."	"Diving happens in football to win a penalty from the referee, it is a skill that players used to practice. Nowadays it is punishable as a simulation foul and the player can be carded for it.

"Passage: ZOFIA NEHRINGOWA (sometimes identified by her married surnames DUDA and later KRZESZCZYK; 10 May 1910 – 1 January 1972[1]) was a Polish long track speed skater in the late 1920s and 1930s.[2][3]Biography[Nehring skating] Born in Warsaw, Nehringowa started skating when she was 15 years old at the _Warszawskie Towarzystwo Łyżwiarskie_ (Warsaw Ice Skating Society) and was trained by Edward Nehring (born 1892). From 1930 she skated for KS Polonia Warszawa.[4][5][6]Twelve times she was the Polish champion, including 4 times champion at the Polish Allround Championships in 1931, 1932, 1935, and 1939. She won the 5000m national title in 1931 and 1934.[7]Her results in the 500m (1:02.00 from 15 February 1931), 1000m (2:16.4 from 26 January 1929) 1500m (3:28.0 from 27 January 1929), 3000m (6:52.8 from 8 February 1931) and 5000 m (11:30.5 from 15 February 1931) were approved by the International Skating Union (ISU) on 3 December 1931 as the first women's speed skating world records.[8][9][10][11][12]Nehringowa competed during 1932 European Speed Skating Championships for Men in Davos, because there was not a rule yet that women's were not allowed to enter races of the men's championships she could take ride all four the distances. Newspapers wrote about this conspicuity and an Austrian skater even withdrew demonstratively from the championship, refusing to compete at the same time against a woman.[13]. During these race she broke the women's world record in the 1500m (3:10.4 on 10 January 1932).[14] A few days later she took back the world record in the 1000m from Liselotte Landbeck (2:03.4 on 17 January 1932 in Engelberg).[15] These successes brought her the 10th place in the Polish Sports Personality of the Year (__) for the best Polish athlete in 1932. [16]On 9 February 1935 she improved her own world record in the 3000m to 6:22,40, and the day afterwards also in the 5000m to 10:54,80.[17][18] On 30 December 1935 in Vienna, she also set a world record in the 10,000m (23:48,5), which was never officially beaten, because in 1953 the ISU decided not to record women's records at this distance.[19]During her career she rode sixteen Polish national records in the individual distances. [20]Nehringowa represented her nation at the World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Women in 1939 where she finished 5th overall (in the individual distances she was 8th (500 m), 4th (3000 m), 7th (1000 m) and 3rd (10,000 m).[21][22]On 20 September 1936 she was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit, awarded by Colonel Władysław Kiliński.[23]Personal lifeIn 1927, at 16 or 17, she married her trainer Edward Nehring, then about 35, and had two children with him. They divorced, and after World War II she married Nehring a second time.[24][25][26]RecordsWorld recordsNehringowa was the first person to set world records recognized by the ISU.

"Passage: ZOFIA NEHRINGOWA (sometimes identified by her married surnames DUDA and later KRZESZCZYK; 10 May 1910 – 1 January 1972[1]) was a Polish long track speed skater in the late 1920s and 1930s.[2][3]Biography[Nehring skating] Born in Warsaw, Nehringowa started skating when she was 15 years old at the _Warszawskie Towarzystwo Łyżwiarskie_ (Warsaw Ice Skating Society) and was trained by Edward Nehring (born 1892). From 1930 she skated for KS Polonia Warszawa.[4][5][6]Twelve times she was the Polish champion, including 4 times champion at the Polish Allround Championships in 1931, 1932, 1935, and 1939. She won the 5000m national title in 1931 and 1934.[7]Her results in the 500m (1:02.00 from 15 February 1931), 1000m (2:16.4 from 26 January 1929) 1500m (3:28.0 from 27 January 1929), 3000m (6:52.8 from 8 February 1931) and 5000 m (11:30.5 from 15 February 1931) were approved by the International Skating Union (ISU) on 3 December 1931 as the first women's speed skating world records.[8][9][10][11][12]Nehringowa competed during 1932 European Speed Skating Championships for Men in Davos, because there was not a rule yet that women's were not allowed to enter races of the men's championships she could take ride all four the distances. Newspapers wrote about this conspicuity and an Austrian skater even withdrew demonstratively from the championship, refusing to compete at the same time against a woman.[13]. During these race she broke the women's world record in the 1500m (3:10.4 on 10 January 1932).[14] A few days later she took back the world record in the 1000m from Liselotte Landbeck (2:03.4 on 17 January 1932 in Engelberg).[15] These successes brought her the 10th place in the Polish Sports Personality of the Year (__) for the best Polish athlete in 1932. [16]On 9 February 1935 she improved her own world record in the 3000m to 6:22,40, and the day afterwards also in the 5000m to 10:54,80.[17][18] On 30 December 1935 in Vienna, she also set a world record in the 10,000m (23:48,5), which was never officially beaten, because in 1953 the ISU decided not to record women's records at this distance.[19]During her career she rode sixteen Polish national records in the individual distances. [20]Nehringowa represented her nation at the World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Women in 1939 where she finished 5th overall (in the individual distances she was 8th (500 m), 4th (3000 m), 7th (1000 m) and 3rd (10,000 m).[21][22]On 20 September 1936 she was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit, awarded by Colonel Władysław Kiliński.[23]Personal lifeIn 1927, at 16 or 17, she married her trainer Edward Nehring, then about 35, and had two children with him. They divorced, and after World War II she married Nehring a second time.[24][25][26]RecordsWorld recordsNehringowa was the first person to set world records recognized by the ISU.

"Passage: Dawn of DarknessDark clouds blocked out the sun. Thunder rolled and boomed, as lightning lit up the skies. Below, the salty waves tossed and tumbled, growing larger as the wind whipped and raged from the north. The rain came down in torrents, pelting the deck of the wooden ship, and soaking the wood. The first mate barked out orders to the crew who busied themselves to carry those orders out. The sails were taken in, so as to not be blown off course. The idea was to wait out the storm, as the waves weren’t so bad that they needed to get out of danger. Near the bow, on top deck, a woman cloaked in a silver robe stood by a man who was robbed in royal purple. Both had crowns fastened to their heads. Soldiers stood by, on edge from the storm, but otherwise relaxed. The man smiled down at his wife and looked to the small bundle of joy she held in her arms. A small child, nearly a year old, rested against her mother’s breast. She had dark, nearly obsidian black hair. Her emerald green eyes were closed now, resting while the storm raged on around them. Her little fingers curled tightly around her mother’s necklace. Their calm was shattered by the sound of lightning as it hit the main mast. The following boom of thunder was loud enough to wake the dead. Deckhands scrambled as they tried to put out the fire that was quickly spreading, but another bolt of lighting struck the ship near the stern, and soon they understood their battle with the flames was a lost cause. The captain readied the life boats, and had the king and queen begin to board. A large wave crashed into the side of the ship and the queen and her child were sent flying over the side. The life boat was lowered down into the unforgiving seas. The queen tried to stay close to the boat, but between holding her child’s head above the waves and the weight of her attire, she was quickly losing strength. She felt something brush up against her. The queen was so tired at this point, her arm holding her child threatened to release her. She saw the life boat coming for her, she knew she would be safe soon. But her child.. Suddenly she felt her child being taken from her arms, as if the water itself was wishing her to drop the child. She screamed up at the skies to whatever god might be listening. “Save my baby, please! Save my Allene!” Something came up from the waves, a sleek head, covered in scales, long like a horse’s. two horns upon the top of it’s head that looked like blackened icicles, Nearly glowing blue orbs seemed to bring the queen into a state of shock. This was a water dragon. Feared for their ever-changing moods, and loved for their kindness. The desperate mother, without a thought, handed her child up to the dragon, who took it in it’s maw gently. But as the life boats came closer, the dragon’s eyes became a glare. There was a man raging in the small life boat, he was screaming out of fear, and waved a sword in the air. The dragon gave a deep growl and sunk below the waves. The queen screamed in horror as she watched her baby disappear beneath the black waves, her strength gave out and she began to sink, hoping to join her child in a watery grave. Large hands pulled at her soaked body before she could embrace the darkness that surrounded her and she was pulled into the chaos of life. She sobbed openly as her king held her, the dread and hatred in his eyes was enough to keep the crew silent while they worked on getting everyone safely to shore. The closest line of safety being Conach Moore, an island that held many mountains. On the eastern side there was a small village that would be able to help them get home to Riochtdome. Beneath the unforgiving waves, in the calm depths of the ocean, the water dragon still carried the young child in it’s maw, a protective barrier surrounded it so that water did not enter the child’s lungs. The dragon had sensed darkness in the King’s heart and sought to save both the mother and the child, but when she had looked for the mother, the king was already pulling her with him. With a heavy heart she took the child to her home, Farlig Dyre. It was a rather large island, filled with forests, mountains, rivers, and plains. It was a beautiful land where Humans dared not tread, and Dragons lived peacefully. She swam up to the edge of the massive cliff that served as a shoreline, digging her claws into the rough earth as she hauled her long, lithe body up the mountainous wall. Her deep blue scales dripped water and left a wet trail as she climbed over the wall and onto the soft lush grass of the northern forest. She placed the now awake, and yet peaceful child, onto the ground. She held her massive head to the sky and beckoned her elders with a roar. As she waited for the sounds of familiar wings beating against the wind, she gathered a few logs and used her claw to dig a small, shallow hole She placed the logs inside and lit a fire with her maw. Her fire was blue, but unlike most fires, it wasn’t as hot as it should be. It was warm, like a sunny day rather than a bursting inferno. She placed the child near the edge of it so as to keep it warm, spreading one of her small wings over her so as to keep her dry. She curled herself up around the child the mother had called Allene, and looked to the skies, awaiting the judgment of her elders. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about the king and queen's relationship?"

"Passage: [Remains of the Chungar Mine camp that was destroyed by a landslide-generated wave at the Yanawayin Lake. Picture looking SW.] [Yanawayin Lake and, behind, the landslide that destroyed most of the Chungar Mine camp in 1971. Picture looking E.] [Upper part of the landslide that generated the tsunami that destroyed most of the Chungar Mine camp in 1971. Picture looking S.]The CHUNGAR MINE, inactive, exploited a polymetallic (Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag) skarn deposit in the high Andes of central Peru. It is located about 116 km NE of Lima, 57 km southwest of Cerro de Pasco, and 82 km northwest of La Oroya in the (Santa Cruz de Andamarca District, Huaral Province, Lima Region, , 4380 m.a.s.l.). In 1971, a landslide-generated wave (“landslide tsunami”[1]) at the Yanawayin Lake destroyed most of the surface facilities and killed 200-600 persons,[2][3] including miners in flooded underground workings.[4]The mine was owned by Cia. Minera Chungar, S.A.C. After the 1971 disaster, this mining company, keeping the same name, transferred the operations 16 km NE to the Animón mine in the Huarón Mining District.Between 1995 and 2008, Compañía Minera Cerro S.A. rehabilitated some underground workings and had a small scale operation.Since 2015, the mining company Volcan is exploring the surroundings of the Chungar Mine (Romina project) including the Puagjanca area where a Zn-Pb-(Ag) ore body was discovered.[5]Confusion on the term “Chungar Mine”The mining company Volcan through its now subsidiary Compañía Minera Chungar S.A.C.[6], operates the polymetallic Animón and Islay mines, in the Huarón Mining District, located 16 km NE of the actual Chungar Mine, under the term “Mining Unit Chungar”[7] (Unidad minera Chungar[8]). The use by Volcan of this term “Chungar Mining Unit”[9][10][11] has caused some confusion, and certain sources (e.g., the data base “alicia.concytec.gob.pe”[12] and a WoodMackenzie Report[13]) use wrongly the term of “Chungar mine” for the Animón mine.Geological FrameThe Chungar skarn deposit belongs to the Miocene polymetallic belt of Central Peru.[14] The skarn Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag mineralization occurs mainly at the western contact of the Chungar Granite with limestone of the Cretaceous Jumasha Formation and in roof pendants.[15] Ore consists mainly of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite in andradite skarn.[16] Age determinations on the outcropping Chungar granite yield an age of 12.88 ± 0.36 Ma (Ar/Ar biotite plateau age)[17] that is consistent with previous K-Ar age determinations.[18]Similar skarn occurrences are known north and south of the Chungar Mine (e.g. Don Miguel prospect, , 8 km north of the Chungar Mine and 1 km E of the Chalhuacocha granodiorite, which was K-Ar dated at 10.0±0.3 Ma on biotite,[19] and the Puagjanca ore body, 4 km to the south[20]).[1] https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-landslides-cause-tsunamis?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products landslide tsunamis, USGS, retrieved on April 15, 2020[2] [3] [4] [5] Volcan 2019; Memoria Anual 2018; 199 p.[6] Company profile Compañía Minera Chungar S.A.C.,bnamericas.com, retrieved on April 6, 2020[7] Volcan, Mining units, retrieved on April 6, 2020[8] Volcan, Unidades Mineras, retrieved on April 6, 2020[9] [10] [11] miningdataonline[12] Data Base “alicia.concytec.gob.pe” retrieved on April 6, 2020[13] Chungar zinc mine, WoodMackenzie Report, retrieved on April 6, 2020[14] Noble, D.

"Passage: Ms. Johnson, I remember watching your baby everyday while you and your husband went out to work. I remember having my red hair in a low ponytail.I remember me wearing white clothing on with my brown sandals. I remember everything up until now…And now we both have lost everything because of you.It was a beautiful Friday morning, no one was home except for myself and the baby. After cleaning up in the kitchen, I remember hearing a cough coming from the basement. My initial thought was to get the baby and leave but strangely enough I did not. However, I did continue with whatever needed to be done with the house. For the next few days, this has continued until I spoke with your husband. Yes, this may seem strange and very disrespectful but your husband had deep secrets. He told me that a close friend of his was staying over for awhile until he gets a new place. The guy name is Riley. He’s a yellow skinned man, with high cheekbones, black curly hair, with dark brown eyes. Also, he smoked these skinny, black cigarettes. Although I was skeptical at first, I still decided that it was okay.But as days passed, I felt as if there were more eyes on me than usual. Paranoia has stricken me while being in that house. Unfortunately, it did not stop me from sleeping when being there. It was a Saturday afternoon, the house was silent. While I was on the couch, my mind was telling me something. As if it it knew something bad was going to happen. But I brushed the idea off and drifted off into sleep.Two hours later… I jumped from my sleep and saw two men standing before me. They both were wearing all black and they were both prepared for whatever was to come. The man on my left, was running full force ahead of me. My immediate reaction was to kick him dead in the nuts, then pick up the vase that is sitting on the coffee table and knock it upside his head. Quickly enough, I took a piece of the broke vase and proceeded to stab him in the right eye with it. Slowly enough, took his eyeball out of his socket. That is when I noticed that the other guy disappeared. I only had a few seconds to get the baby and get up out of there.I sprinted up them stairs, ran into the baby’s bedroom. I grabbed his baby bag that is always prepared in case of emergency and the baby. Popped opened that window, stepped out onto the balcony and jumped.Luckily, we survived the jump and I was able to get up and run down the street. This run felt like eternity when in reality it was only two minutes that passed. One of my biggest regrets was looking back. Within a blink of an eye, a different man in all black tackled us onto the ground. The man on top of me and the baby had pinned us down to the ground. He turned around and signaled his men to come over. With that, I was able to raise my upper body up to see the baby. Although his eyes were closed he had this beautiful smile on him. “NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!” I quietly screamed out. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and laughed. I started to tear up because I really thought I lost him. Nevertheless, when something good happens there is always the worst to come. So, the man that chased us brought to this old 1970 black camaro. On the car it that had a bright orange spray paint mark on the passenger side door, and the car had these fresh rims. When first upon entering into the car, there was this light skinned, bald headed man who seemed to be his in late forties on the driver side of the seat. The only words he told me was, “buck up sweetheart it’s gonna be long a ride.”Thank you Mr. Johnson, for bringing misery to us.

However, I did continue with whatever needed to be done with the house. For the next few days, this has continued until I spoke with your husband. Yes, this may seem strange and very disrespectful but your husband had deep secrets. He told me that a close friend of his was staying over for awhile until he gets a new place. The guy name is Riley. He’s a yellow skinned man, with high cheekbones, black curly hair, with dark brown eyes. Also, he smoked these skinny, black cigarettes. Although I was skeptical at first, I still decided that it was okay.But as days passed, I felt as if there were more eyes on me than usual. Paranoia has stricken me while being in that house. Unfortunately, it did not stop me from sleeping when being there. It was a Saturday afternoon, the house was silent. While I was on the couch, my mind was telling me something. As if it it knew something bad was going to happen. But I brushed the idea off and drifted off into sleep.Two hours later… I jumped from my sleep and saw two men standing before me. They both were wearing all black and they were both prepared for whatever was to come. The man on my left, was running full force ahead of me. My immediate reaction was to kick him dead in the nuts, then pick up the vase that is sitting on the coffee table and knock it upside his head. Quickly enough, I took a piece of the broke vase and proceeded to stab him in the right eye with it. Slowly enough, took his eyeball out of his socket. That is when I noticed that the other guy disappeared. I only had a few seconds to get the baby and get up out of there.I sprinted up them stairs, ran into the baby’s bedroom. I grabbed his baby bag that is always prepared in case of emergency and the baby. Popped opened that window, stepped out onto the balcony and jumped.Luckily, we survived the jump and I was able to get up and run down the street. This run felt like eternity when in reality it was only two minutes that passed. One of my biggest regrets was looking back. Within a blink of an eye, a different man in all black tackled us onto the ground. The man on top of me and the baby had pinned us down to the ground. He turned around and signaled his men to come over. With that, I was able to raise my upper body up to see the baby. Although his eyes were closed he had this beautiful smile on him. “NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!” I quietly screamed out. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and laughed. I started to tear up because I really thought I lost him. Nevertheless, when something good happens there is always the worst to come. So, the man that chased us brought to this old 1970 black camaro. On the car it that had a bright orange spray paint mark on the passenger side door, and the car had these fresh rims. When first upon entering into the car, there was this light skinned, bald headed man who seemed to be his in late forties on the driver side of the seat. The only words he told me was, “buck up sweetheart it’s gonna be long a ride.”Thank you Mr. Johnson, for bringing misery to us.

"The woman doesn't initially think that anything could happen while she's alone in the house with only the baby. However, after hearing the cough coming from the basement, the woman starts to feel paranoid. When the man tells her of his friend who is staying in the home, she is skeptical but decides to let him stay. After she falls asleep, the two men in all black approach and overpower her. She uses a piece of a broken vase in order to stab one of the men in the eye. In spite of her attempts to fight back, she is subdued and taken to the camaro with the bald-headed driver.******The woman first kicks the assailant in the groin and uses the remaining piece of a broken vase to stab the assailant's eye. She is then able to escape from the house and its occupants to save herself and the baby. The altercation on the ground makes the woman realize she has to fight her way out in order to save herself and the baby. She must be proactive and use any means necessary in order to escape her attackers. Although it seems like an uphill battle, she does not give up. She uses her strength and ingenuity to subdue the assailants. She uses whatever is at her disposal to create a way to get out of the situation alive.******The woman kicks the man in the genitals and then attacks with a vase before using a piece of it to stab him in the eye.

"Passage: This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the motets of Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV225-230). However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of _Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden_, BWV 230, one of the “six”.A single CD has the capacity to contain the set of six motets plus some other works. For example, Maasaki Suzuki's 2009 recording with the Bach Collegium Japan on BIS includes _O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht_, BWV 118 (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and _Ich lasse dich nicht_, BWV Anh. 159 (the authorship of which has been disputed).[1] The motets chosen for a particular recording project can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in more interest in recording the piece in question. For example, was not included by John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording,[2] by which time scholarly opinion had re-assessed the work.Recordings have also been made of the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, Wolfgang Helbich recorded _The Apocryphal Bach Motets_, sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).[3][4]Types of choirsChoirs with one voice per part (OVPP) are used in some historically informed performances of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the Hilliard Ensemble's second set,[5] and Konrad Junghänel with the group Cantus Cölln.[6] Philippe Herreweghe's second set uses OVPP for some motets, for example _Jesus meine Freude_, and not others.[7]At least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's Thomanerchor, which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under Günther Ramin in the 1950s),[8] as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the Choir of New College, Oxford.[9]Instrumental accompanimentMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches:-   _a cappella_, that is, without an accompaniment-   instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing _colla parte_-   Basso continuo, or just an organ accompaniment, to provide some instrumental support for the singersSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, BWV 226 orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two oboes, taille and bassoon). There is also a basso continuo provided (separate violone and organ parts) which underlies both choirs.[10] An accompaniment is also specified for _Lobet den Herrn_.[11]La Petite Bande and Bach Collegium Japan, for example, use the orchestration of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_ for the other pieces for double choir. However, _a capella_ performance is long-established tradition,[12] which is also reflected in recordings. The Hilliard Ensemble's OVPP version is mainly _a capella_. They omit the instrumental parts of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, but sing _Lobet den Herrn_ to organ accompaniment.[13]The recordings with continuo accompaniment include The Sixteen's version (the instruments are cello, violone, theorbo, organ) and the second recording by the Monteverdi Choir (cello, double bass, bassoon and organ).[14]HistoryThe first of the motets to be recorded was _Jesu meine Freude_ in 1927. This version was sung in English.[15]AwardsIn 2010, Suzuki and his ensemble were given a French award (Diapason d’Or de l’Année) and a German award (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik) for their recording of Bach motets on BIS.John Eliot Gardiner, who has won more Gramophone Awards than any other living artist, received one for his second recording of the motets with the Monteverdi Choir on SDG. It was one of the 2013 awards, the category being “Baroque Vocal”.Grete Pedersen with the Norwegian choir Det Norske Solistkor won a Diapason d'Or in 2018 for their recording of the motets on BIS.DiscographyThe intention has been to feature versions which are still available. The year given is that of recording. In the case of pre-1980s recordings, the date of reissue on CD can be significantly later than the original recording.Notes[1] [2] _Bach: Motets_ and _Bach Motets_ at .[3] _The Apocryphal Bach Motets: BWV Anh. 159–165_ at .[4] The Sacred Apocryphal Bach (8 CD set) at ArkivMusic website.[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  Accessed via JSTOR (subscription required)[12] Emery, W.

"Passage: MOHAMMAD ASADDOR ALI (), was a Bangladeshi writer, researcher and historian. His research primarily focused on the history of Sylhet. Due to his achievements, he was awarded the Bangla Academy Literary Award in 2004.[1] His research discovered unknown information about folk literature, and he wrote 19 books relating to it.[2]Early lifeAli was born into a Bengali Muslim family in the village of Ludorpur in Jagannathpur, Sunamganj Subdivision in 1929. He was the third child of a family of five sons and one daughter. His mother, Mastura Khatun, was a teacher at the Ludorpur Ayaan Munshi Primary School. His father's name was Moulvi Muhammad Uthman Ullah.[3][4]He studied in a _pathshala_ in the nearby village of Syedpur where he passed second place in the primary exam. He then studied in Government Jubilee High School where he completed his matriculation exams, before completing his I.A. and I.B. in Murari Chand College. Following this, he went to Dhaka University where he did a Master of Arts in Bengali language and Bengali literature. In the Govt. Teachers' Training College, he completed a Bachelor of Education degree from a talent scholarship.[5] He was the first person in his village to graduate from a university.[6]CareerAfter graduating, Ali became a teacher at the Madan Mohan College.

He was also vice-chairman and patron for the Kendriya Muslim Sahitya Sangsad for quite a long time. Studying the Mymensingh Gitika, he was able to find evidence that nine of them were actually of Sylheti origin.[7] Ali corrected Ahmed Sharif, who wrote in his PhD thesis that medieval writer Shaykh Chand was from Chittagong, that the latter was actually from the Sylhet region. Ali was also of the opinion that Syed Sultan was a Sylheti.[8] He established a large personal library, which has benefited many future researchers.

Qonqurtai was Hulagu's ninth son and was the senior commander during the reign of his brother Abaqa. He was twice appointed as viceroy of Anatolia, first during the reign of Abaqa and then under Tekuder.

As a consequence, Mehmet I of Karaman was captured and executed together with his sons Mahmud and Karaman in October 1277.[2] Qonqurtai further authorised Sâhib Ata to act on his behalf.

"Passage: “Mom..” a boy cried.“Is it okay if I’m the only one that love you in this world..”His mother, with a loving smile says” I would be so happy, that I couldn’t stop smiling”I woke up. In the end, it was just a sweet dream. A dream that perhaps , I wish to stay forever. I got up, did my daily morning routine, kiss my father and go to school. Oh, I also bring my camera with me wherever I go. Not the hipster one! Just the regular simple camera type. You know, to capture the moment. Still an amateur though. Though it was a give I got from a dear friend of mine.A few moments stepping out, I notice a man. Perhaps he is waiting someone as he showed no sign of haste. The man turned. A trace of smile slid on his face. Pretentious postmen, I presume to myself. A letter and a box were given for a few signatures and the man left. Puzzled, I took the package not knowing what inside. Before my clever assumption flow, I was stunned. The letter senders were under the name Alexa, my childhood friend. I stood there for too long not sure what I’m doing exactly. Somehow I came back to my senses and impatiently went back to open the box. Inside it, were full of memories of Alexa. Her photobook, novels and deep down was her diary. With a large word spell “No Reading”.I was dumbfounded, what on earth she was thinking sending me this.  Still , the notion of her secret in my hand excites me . After taking everything outside the box a simple note was left underneath everything. It says “Read the letter first you dumbass!”. “Okay , okay . Seriously , like literally, she could order me around whether she around or not” . Wondering, I read her letter quietly in the depth of the silent living room.   “God, bless you for the beautiful moment we shared . Many times I once wondered , if you still have the thought of my existence at all.  I wish you were, if not then you weren’t. “Got a chase last night” the story I wrote, nobody knew but I couldn’t care less. It caught your attention though , and more and more you surprised me. Till one letter that make me fell for you. HARD.  Everytime I read your letter, that joke always catch me .Liar, told me to catch me even I was a storm. Hahaha, how do you intend to do that? I want to kiss you in the same time kick you.God, blessed you with patient and I hope you are patient now as you reading this. I have come to realize that I love you .And my love still stabs me through the brain. I couldn’t find myself forget you. Like the way the wind hit you, you couldn’t help but face it. So much that this feeling is unconsciously conscious of you. I know I’m maybe exaggerating a little but I couldn’t help it.Maybe I should end this letter here, for nobody knows what to expect in the near future but do me favor, let me go away.                                                          Alexa”Huh, this is all to sudden. I reread it gazillion time again making sure what I read perfectly justify what I understood. Not long enough after that I found her picture, sick in the photobook. Each one shows her journey fighting cancer. I couldn’t believe she hid the fact that she was sick from me. More and more picture, more and more droplet of water stream down my cheek. I couldn’t hold it much longer after the last of her picture, smiling so brightly in the midst of dying. Finally, I realize. Moments in life seems to go by fast and takes a long time one to realize, the best of it went by soundlessly. In the end, I kept her diary untouched.

"Passage: Chapter 1: The Rules, Rankings and ResponsibilitiesFinally God allows me to tell my tale. First off, I am an angel. It takes centuries to become a Dream Guardian. You need to understand more than what several lifetimes can teach you.¬ Demons have no rules and no pattern just like nightmares. I do not deal with demons any more but that is for another tale.Dream Guardians are still angels and we have rules while our enemies do not. Rules are in place for YOUR protection not ours I mean, it’s not like we can die but you can. Our rules are more guidelines and can be broken as we see fit. Firstly, do not show yourself unless absolutely necessary. You know that feeling you get when you feel calm even though you see something that would usually scare you during sleep paralysis? That is something we can do but it isn’t the best choice if you are in danger. We can’t attack during this. Secondly, only put people into a state of sleep paralysis if you are in danger in your sleep and you can’t break free from being held or touched in any way from a monster. Putting you in a state of paralysis is a last resort but buys us a few seconds as they have to re-enter your “sanctuary”. And lastly, we are invisible by choice. We need to wake you before they touch you. Everyone isn't the same to wake up so we don’t know how hard it will be. We try to fight them as you sleep. Those nightmares you have but wake up and can’t remember? We showed ourselves to fight which erases the dream altogether.Everybody has a different imagination and fear so we have no idea what we are fighting. This is why we are the top angels in heaven. Demons don’t change, their motives do. And we don’t have wings by the way. We can fly but we look like we did back in the mortal world.People we do not manage to save die, or more commonly known, “bed death” or “cot death”. Some missions will never leave your memory. The hardest part is seeing them at the pearl gates and explaining what happened. As a sign of respect we take 6 earth months off to look over the family and help them through. Very rarely God allows us to project dreams of lost ones into the affected peoples dream so they can say goodbye properly. It is something every Guardian Angel has been through yet it does not get any easier. Imagine kissing your child goodnight and without knowing goodbye too. They sleep in perfect health in their favourite pyjamas wrapped in their blanket with their scent on it. Waiting, excited or any other emotion for tomorrow to inevitably come. But it never does, it never will. The night takes a toll and by morning they are gone. You watch as the first person who tries to wake them start being concerned and then begin to shake. Full denial until they feel their pulse. They break down with their uniform still in hand ready to get them changed for school and just as their knees grow weak they fall to the ground screaming uncontrollably as the rest of the family come running in realising what has happened and no one has anything to say but cry and ask God why. The ambulance comes and declares the rough time of death as you watch helplessly knowing this is your fault and you can’t say sorry. The rest of the day is carried out with the family being closer than they ever have been. People offering their condolences but nothing in the world can make them better than to bring the child back. But nothing can bring them back. And the worst part? The worst part is when they kiss them goodbye and say “I love you” as tears helplessly run down their face. The pain is unimaginable. Children are the hardest to save, their imaginations are a lot wilder and they don’t understand how one minute they can be hugging their parents and the next minute an unknown figure is holding them tight crushing them. They are too weak and confused and just before they draw a last breath they are in a sleep paralysis. The one DAMN THING I can rely on usually and I only make them more helpless as not all children understand that the bedroom is the safest place so they don’t have a sanctuary yet and the monster is already on top of them choking them before I can wake them. PLEASE make your children understand they are safe in their bedroom. I can’t describe the feeling of fear and sickness I get when I realise a child does not feel safe where they sleep. And yes this is one of many true stories. He was 5. He was the energy of the family and all they can do is look at photos. Just by smiling he would light up any of their days. He was kind and gentle and too young to understand why he left his family behind. You know, people cry in heaven too.His safest place was in the living room on the carpet with his toys. That is no good to me. Not when he sleeps in his bed. I watched as a small coffin, much smaller than it should ever be for anyone get carried to a grave. I stood by the gravestone crying too. I remembered as I seen the fear in his eyes as I made him experience his first paralysis and last. His last words will haunt me from now to eternity… “Please save me I don’t want to go”. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about sleep paralysis in children?"	"Children are the hardest to save, since their imaginations are wilder and they don't understand sleep paralysis. They wind up too weak and confused.******At least one child, too young to sleep in his own bed, has been killed by a sleeping nightmare monster before life fades away. The child was killed despite the child not sleeping in a bed as the child would usually cling to his mother until she yells at him to go to bed; a behavior from the time when the child would still sleep in the same room as his parents. Sleep paralysis is the only safe thing no one ever gets used to, the narrator explains, so when it happens suddenly it's terrifying. A child is more likely to think their own parents are the monster when the child feels their life is in danger, the narrator says. The child's last words haunt the narrator to eternity.******Children have wild imaginations and they don't understand how one minute they can be hugging their parents and the next minute an unknown figure is holding them tight crushing them. They are reluctant to admit that the monster attacking them is too real. They are too weak and confused and just before they draw a last breath they are in a sleep paralysis. They dread sleep in a way their parents never do.******Angel says children have wild imaginations and they don't understand how one minute they can be hugging their parents and the next minute an unknown figure is holding them tight crushing them.

"Passage: “Daisy….”a soft voice whispered in the dim light.Daisy looked around, startled.“Whoever you are, go away.” Daisy said trying to place the voice. It was so familiar….“Not a chance. You’re stuck with me now and you won’t be able to ignore me anymore” he hissed. “I h-haven’t been ignoring you. I’m just very….”“LIAR! You know you can’t lie to me, Daisy.”Daisy burst into tears.“Oh shut up. You can be such a baby sometimes.”“W-what are you going to do to me?” Daisy asked while trying to control her sobs.“I’m not going to DO anything to you. I just want to help you fill in the gaps.”“What gaps?”“The ones in your memory. For example, can you remember what you had for breakfast yesterday?”“Of course! I had…. Uh…”He chuckled.“Daisy, Daisy, Daisy. You had oatmeal with sliced bananas on top.”“I knew that! Shut up!”“Do you remember Louis?”“You mean my husband of four years? Yeah, like I could ever forget him.”“Then you must remember what you did to him, right?” Daisy could hear the smirk in his voice, and scrunched her face trying to sift through her memories. She couldn’t stand this bastard knowing more than her.“I… I haven’t done anything to him.”“Oh really? Absolutely nothing? Hah! Clearly you need me more than you know. You can’t remember anything.”This time he laughed out loud, not even bothering to hide his contempt. “There’s nothing to remember. You’re just fucking with me. Shut up!”Daisy turned away, resolved to end this conversation.“Let’s play a little game. I’m going to describe an event, and you’re going to try to remember it.”Daisy stayed resolutely silent.“Do you remember yesterday morning? It was a pretty uneventful day. Louis had breakfast with you and then left for work. Do you remember that, Daisy?”Daisy nodded slightly, still trying not to engage.“Do you remember how you burnt his toast?”“I’m always doing things like that. Louis didn’t mind though.”“And the bruise on your arm?”“This little thing?” Daisy poked at it. “I was cleaning up and I dropped a dish. I must’ve hit my arm while picking it back up.”Even Daisy could hear the uncertainty in her voice.“Louis was so worried about it, too. He gave me an ice pack, and told me he loved and that he was sorry. I’m so lucky to have a man like him in my life.”Silence. Daisy ran her answer through her head over and over, trying to see if there were any gaps or mistakes. “And the stitches two months ago?”“Another case of my notorious clumsiness. Louis was having some fun, and threw a glass at me…. I mean to me. I didn’t catch it and somehow managed to break it on top of that. I sliced open my hand on one of the pieces.  I needed twelve stitches.” Daisy started laughing at herself.“Louis was so nice after that! He visited me at the hospital every day, and gave me the most beautiful flowers. He kept saying over and over that he loved me and that he was sorry. He was always so sorry for my clumsiness…”More silence. He studied Daisy for a bit, and in a gentler tone said, “See, this game isn’t that hard. Now let’s skip to the end of yesterday.”“Let’s see, Louis came home from work; I fixed him dinner; he ate it; we watched TV; and then went to bed…. You’re right this game is easy.”He let out a low, cool chuckle, any tenderness gone in a flash. “Wrong! That’s not what happened last night. You’re omitting one crucial detail. Do you want another go? Maybe use a lifeline?”“Uh, I can’t remember anything else…”“And that’s what I’m here for. To help you…” his voice became more and more serpentine.“The first part of your memory is spot on: you made him dinner, and he ate, and then watched TV. The last part, however, is a lie.”“What do you mean?”“Louis never made it to bed. Do you wanna know why?”“No. You’re lying! He went to bed!”“He never went to bed because he’s dead! You killed him!”“No! No… I would never do that! I’m a good person. Louis loved me! Why would I murder him?”“Bull shit! You’ve been planning this ever since you became extremely ‘clumsy’. You chose a knife because it made no sound, and you could watch the life drain from his body by your hand. You knew that slitting his throat would be both painful and silent. So you took your chef’s knife and walked into the living room. You went silently behind him and started stroking his hair. He moaned softly and you quickly drew his face up towards yours as if to kiss him. But instead of a kiss you drew the knife across his throat. He bled more than you thought he would, but it was worth it to see that look of understanding cross his face. He knew he was dying and that you had killed him!”“NO no no no no no no…”Daisy started rocking back and forth.“You didn’t count on me though, did you? You planned everything so carefully, and once it was over, your mind neatly erased any memory of it. Except me. I’ll always be here, Daisy. That voice inside your head, forcing you to remember what you’ve done to me!”And he started to laugh. Slowly at first but building into something maniacal and menacing. Daisy suddenly realized why the voice was so familiar, and broke down in tears again. She retreated to the corner, grabbed her knees, and continued to rock, mumbling no under her breath over and over. *****Behind the one way mirror the doctor looked at the woman in the corner of the cell and said, “Where did you find her?”“She was wandering the streets downtown. She seemed to be talking to herself so I called the cops and just wanted to make sure she got some help. I’m glad they put her here with you. She seems safer in here.”“She seems to have suffered some sort of mental break. She has injuries consistent with long term abuse and there was some blood on the clothes she came in with. So far she’s been unresponsive and I don’t know if we’ll ever find out who she is. Thank you for your help Mr…” the doctor glances down at the police report, “Tully.” Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What can we determine about the voice speaking to Daisy?"	"The voice says it wants to help Daisy, but soon after the voice says it wants to make her remember what she's done to it. The voice is male and seems to be playing a game with Daisy, he wants Daisy to recall a murder she committed. The voice is that of the man Daisy murdered, her physically abusive husband."
"Passage: ""Guys, I think we need to think about the Christmas lunch. I know a lot of you are attached to the gift exchange, but I think this year we should try something new. It's called charity."" Diane opened her arms like a basket overflowing and there was a long pause as everyone in the group simultaneously choked puke back down their throats. ""I think we should buy gifts for a needy family instead of exchanging them with each other.""""That's a great idea, Diane. But maybe we should just do our charity on our own. A lot of us like the gift exchange."" Tim said, fighting back the anger at the idea of being made to give to charity. Tim was a conservative in the sense that he conserved most of his emotions for blowing way the fuck up at small slights he felt were forced on him. ""Tim, Christmas is about giving - not taking. Why don't we go the extra mile here and -"" But Diane was cut off mid sentence by Jessica! ""Christmas? Christmas? Is this 1960? Are we on the set of Mad Men? Please don't use that word to describe our seasonal exchange of peace! It's called 'The Holidays' or 'Seasonal Party'. Christmas? I don't believe you, Diane. I thought you were more informed than that. George is Jewish. Talia is Islamic. And Ruth is that one where they don't believe in holidays...""""Jehovah's Witness."" Ruth said.""What about my rights? I'm Christian and I don't like you people taking the Christ out of the holiday."" Glenda chimed in.""You people?"" Michael X asked.""The bible is my favorite book, and I think we should all take a note from Joh -""""Which version?""""Version of what?""""Which version of the bible?"" Stan was upset.""King James."" Stan made a fart noise. ""Please.""""You know there's many books of the bible, not just the -"" ""Bah, you're Mormon.""""What does that have to do with anything?""""I heard Mormons believe in a monster God that flew to Earth in a 747!""""That's Scientologists!""""They're all crazy!""""I'm a Scientologist!"" ""Yeah, and you're crazy.""""STOP!"" Diane yelled. ""Look, I thought maybe you all would like to join in a charitable effort. But I guess not. I guess..."" She began weeping. ""I guess you're all too enamored in your own beliefs to believe in the one belief we all hold true - love.""Stan made the farting noise again.""Why don't we have a potluck?"" ""Is that some Indian thing?""""They're called Native Americans!"" ""Not if their Indian. Like from India, you fuckhead.""""Fuck you, I don't want a potluck. This isn't Kwanza.

We need to pull together."" It was Tim this time. He was crying. But not out of sadness for our souls, but out of pure rage. ""I will NOT be forced to give to charity. Or vote for Obama. Or wash my hands EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I. USE. THE. BATHROOM!""Everyone stopped and looked around at each other and then at Tim. ""You don't always wash your hands? Gross."" Diane made a face. She had stopped weeping and found a new charity - the one where you give ridicule. ""Tim doesn't wash his hands!""Everyone started laughing. I looked around and there was a general sense of togetherness, something that religions, charities, and politicians cannot put together. Something stronger. Something beautiful. It was the act of not being the person being made fun of.Tim looked around the room and finding no clear target for his rage, decided to punch the coffee maker and then he stormed out as laughter followed him down the halls. Finally, the room composed itself and Diane began again. ""OK. I'm not feeling a lot of love for the charity. So, let's go ahead and just do our gift exchange, at a restaurant, like usual."" She smiled at the group.""What restaurant?""And with that, chaos ensued. Employees shot from their chairs and grabbed whatever was nearby and began pummeling their neighbor. ""Outback!"" ""Red Robin!""""Ninos!"" ...were the battle cries that day. I hid under a desk and watched Diane use a letter opener to stab Jane in the ear repeatedly. The idea of charity was long gone and she only craved the sound of metal plunging into brain. Jon was trying to fit Harry down the garbage chute, Becka was strangling Don with a phone cord, Thom was in the corner raping a fern for reasons unknown...The battle went on and I was able to ride it out under my desk smoking cigarettes and drinking mini bottles of Rum that I had received at the last Peace in the Middle East and End Smoking lunch.Finally, a champion appeared. It was Ruth. She was dragging Michael X's body on a cross she had made from the cubicle uprights. The rest of the employees were dead, dying, or too injured to protest when Ruth, bloodied, stood on her desk and proclaimed ""We shall have a white elephant gift exchange. At Denny's. We will call it a Seasonal Party. We will wear ugly...ugly...sweaters..."" and then she gasped and fell to the ground dead.The only sound was Thom continuing to have sex with a fern.I slowly walked out. I was the only survivor of the Seasonal Party discussion. It was 1996. Hallmark headquarters.

"Passage: “Mummy, tell me the story of Die Sine Timere,” whispered Jerry to his mother as she leaned over to tuck him in. He’d heard the story about a million times, from his friends and teachers and family, but he loved it best when his mother told it. Besides, the holiday was tomorrow, and hearing the story would help calm his excitement enough to sleep. His mother smiled at him and adjusted his pillows.“Are you sure? You practically know it by heart at this point,” she replied. He looked up at her and smiled an imploring smile.“Please?”His mother laughed a little and sat down next to him on the bed. “Well...okay,” she whispered. She looked out his window and saw the holiday’s festive banner flapping from between two street lamps on the road. The banner read “Welcome to the 3045 Celebration of Die Sine Timere!” It waved back and forth in the wind. She turned back to Jerry, who was now propped up on his pillows and looking at her expectantly. “Okay, okay. Well,” she began, “Our story begins a long time ago, way back in 2015. Our ancestors who lived in that time were not like the way we are today. They were wild and crazy and very violent. The whole world was fighting a war with each other, and it was not the first time everyone had been fighting. They loved fighting each other, and they’d find any excuse to go to do it. They fought over religion and money and--”“And oil!” interrupted Jerry excitedly. “Yes, love, and oil. They even fought over who got to live where. It was very silly, but very dangerous. You see, millions of people, innocent people and soldiers alike were getting killed every day. It was horrible. Families were being ripped apart and nobody seemed to be able to make sense of it all. Nobody seemed to understand that everyone was the same underneath the skin and that war was a bad thing. Everyone bleeds red, darling, but our ancestors were too blinded by greed and hatred to see the common color underneath people’s skin. So they fought and fought for years. Finally, one day everyone woke up from sleeping and realized that they had killed off more than half the people on Earth. There used to be seven billion people living there, but now there was only about two billion. Some of the ground was permanently stained red from all the bloodshed. Even the clouds were damaged, and there were holes in the sky from all the bad things our ancestors had put up there. Things had gotten so bad that all the countries knew that they had to stop killing and stop wasting things and stop fighting.”“Did they stop killing each other, Mummy?” asked Jerry, even though he already knew the answer.“Yes, they did, darling. All the countries came together and talked about their problems and decided to stop all wars forever. Everyone began to get along, slowly but surely, and the people started sharing their things with each other. Nobody got called any names and everyone was equal. The first few years of peace were a little scary, because people weren’t sure how long it was going to last. But as the fourth year of peace passed, it became obvious to everyone that it was here to stay. All the leaders of all the countries came together that year and decided that there should be a day of remembrance and happiness and celebration as a global holiday, to be celebrated until the end of peace. They put this holiday on August 21st, which was the day all the wars ended. They decided to call this day “Die Sine Timere,” which is from a very very old language called Latin, and it means “Day Without Fear.” They said that on this day, all the people were to celebrate another year of peace and remember our mistakes in the past to keep us safe in the future. They said that people could celebrate and remember any way they saw fit, but they must be sure to celebrate it each year. Our country celebrates by having large block parties and getting all the communities together for a good time. And for you and all the other children, darling, it’s the one night of the year where you don’t have to go to bed before midnight. You get to stay up very late. And before everyone does go to bed on the night of Die Sine Timere, each family sits together in silent meditation to remember those who died and to help us remain peaceful for the following year.”“Tell me about the lanterns, Mummy. Don’t forget the lanterns,” whispered Jerry, whose eyes were closed now. He was not quiet asleep yet, just listening quietly to the story of his favorite holiday in peace. “Ah, yes, the lanterns,” said his mother, who now was stroking her son’s hair gently as she spoke. “Well, in all the countries around the world, there is one thing that all our ceremonies of peace have in common. Every single person or family makes a special lantern out of biodegradable paper, and they each write a wish for the future or a memory of the past on that lantern. Then, at exactly midnight, each person or family lights the lantern and sends it into the sky, and all the wishes and memories get to soar the night skies together. It’s very beautiful and is a symbol of our unity and peace.”“It’s like watching all our wishes come true,” whispered Jerry. “That it is, my love. That it is,” replied his mother, “And every year, the whole world does the same thing. For one day a year, we remember our unity and how lucky we are to be at peace. Each person meditating or releasing a lantern or playing in the park during the day is a promise for the future. We will remain peaceful, so long as we have this hope.” She stopped, for that was the end of the story. She and her son sat quietly together for a moment, before Jerry let out a contented sigh and rolled on his side, eyes still shut tight. His mother looked down at his little sleeping face and smiled. She leaned down and gently kissed his forehead before getting up off the bed. She tucked the blankets up to his chin and turned to walk away. “Mummy?” Jerry said quietly.“Yes, darling?” said his mother, turning back towards her son.“Goodnight, Mummy. I love you.”“I love you too, Jerry. Goodnight.”She shut off his light and headed downstairs to prepare the rice paper for the lanterns for tomorrow night, so that she and her son could silently watch all their wishes come true.

"Passage: AQUAPELAGO refers to an assemblage of marine and terrestrial elements in which the aquatic spaces are key to community livelihoods and to communities’ senses of identity and belonging.[1]Concept and EtymologyThe term _aquapelago_ was introduced to the field of Island Studies in 2012 by contributors to _Shima_, an online, open-access journal of research into island and maritime cultures.[2] In its initial coinage, by Philip Hayward,[3] Etymologically, the term replaces the initial two syllables of the well-known term “archipelago” with “aqua” in order to reassert the role of marine elements in aggregations of islands that has been largely lost from contemporary usage of the term archipelago.[4] Elaborating the concept, Suwa[5] linked it to livelihood activities and to the Japanese concept of _shima_ (referring to islands and related distinct cultural landscapes). Suwa’s concept is striking in that it conceives of combined terrestrial and aquatic spaces as, effectively, neighborhoods.In a reflection on and expansion of his initial article on the topic, Hayward[6] identified that he envisaged the concept as a reflection on the Anthropocene and as:Subsequent developments of the concept have analysed its applicability to topics such as ocean spaces and national rights of access to these (Fleury[7]), cultural practices in Melanesian coastal societies (Dick[8]) and career making in island communities (Alexander[9]). Writing in the (now defunct) journal _Urban Island Studies_, Hayward[10] expanded on his original analyses by addressing metropolitan locales and providing a characterisation of Manhattan as an aquapelagic city that was subsequently critiqued and modified by Ayasha Guerin.[11] While there have been critics of the concept, such as Baldacchino,[12] who regard the term as unnecessary in that archipelagic analyses can be extended to address aquatic elements, writers from various disciplines have engaged with the concept in a positive manner, such as May Joseph and Sofia Varino’s exploration of the concept with regard to water ecology themed performance works in the journal _Women’s Studies Quarterly_[13] and Barbara Hawkins in her discussion of a geopolitical aesthetic of the subterranean in the journal _Geopolitics_.[14]Associated ConceptsOne significant development of the concept of the aquapelago has concerned the notion of there being an “aquapelagic imaginary.” This idea was originally floated by Hayward in 2017,[15] and was subsequently elaborated in a theme issue of the journal _Shima_ on mermaids, mer-cultures and the aquapelagic imaginary[16] to refer to the manner in which communities’ “engagements with their aquapelagic locales” in folk-/media-loric contexts can be understood to reflect upon and transcend “perceptions of the limits of human presence in and experience of aquatic spaces.”[17] In an article analysing the creation of a modern mythic entity, the Ningen, a creature rumoured to inhabit the southern Pacific Ocean, Greenland and Hayward[18] discuss the aquapelagic imaginary as a “subset"" of the ""social imaginary”, which can be regarded as a historically determined “enabling but not fully explicable symbolic matrix within which a people imagine and act as world-making collective agents”.[19]Further readingA variety of articles on the concept of aquapelago published in the journal _Shima_ and elsewhere are anthologised online at: https://shimajournal.org/anthologies.php[1] Hayward, Philip (2012), “Aquapelagos and Aquapelagic Assemblages” _Shima_ 6 (1), 1-11.[2] Publication Details - Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures [ISSN: 1834-6057][3] [4] There is a degree of irony here in that the term “archipelago” was derived from the Greek arkhi (chief) and pelagos (sea), referring to the Aegean.[5] Suwa, Jun’ichiro (2012) “Shima and Aquapelagic Assemblages” _Shima_ 6 (1), 12-16.[6] Hayward, Philip (2012), “The constitution of assemblages and the aquapelagality of Haida Gwaii” _Shima_ 6 (2), 1-14[7] Fleury, Christian (2013) “The Island/Sea/Territory Relationship” _Shima_ 7 (1), 1-13.[8] Dick, Thomas (2015) “Chorographing the Vanuatu Aquapelago”, _Shima_ 9 (1), 1-22.[9] Alexander, Rosie (2015) “Career Decision Making in Island Communities”, _Shima_ 9 (1), 38-52[10] Hayward, Philip (2015) “The Aquapelago and the Estuarine City: Reflections on Manhattan” _Urban Island Studies_ 1, 81-95.[11] Guerin, Ayasha (2019) “Underground and at Sea: Oysters and Black Marine Entanglements in New York’s Zone A” _Shima_ 13 (2), 30-55.[12] Baldacchino, Godfrey (2012) “Getting Wet: A response to Hayward’s concept of Aquapelagos”, _Shima_ 6 (2), 22-26.[13] Joseph, May and Sofia Varino (2017) “Aquapelagic Assemblages: Performing Water Ecology with Harmattan Theatre” _Women’s Studies Quarterly_ 45 (1-2) 151-166.[14] Hawkins, Barbara (2018) “A Volcanic Incident’: Towards a geopolitical aesthetics of the subterranean” _Geopolitics_ 24 (3), 1-26.[15] Hayward, Philip (2017) _Making a Splash: Representations of Mermaids (and Mermen) in 20th and 21st Century Audiovisual Media_, Eastleigh: John Libbey and Co. pp 6-7.[16] _Shima_ 12 (2), https://shimajournal.org/issues.php[17] Hayward, Philip (2018) “Introduction: Mermaids, Mercultures and the Aquapelagic Imaginary”, _Shima_ 12 (2), 1-2.[18] Greenland, Felicity and Hayward, Philip (2020) “Ningen: The context and generation of media-lore concerning a giant, sub-Antarctic, aquatic humanoid” _Shima_ 14 (1), 33-40.[19] Gaonkar, D.P (2002) ‘Towards New Imaginaries’, _Popular Culture_ 14 (1), 1. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:In what way has the term ""aquapelago"" expanded from scientific to cultural?"	"The term ""aquapelago"" was introduced by contributors to Shima, an online journal of research into island and maritime cultures.  Aquapelago, as a term, is a collection of marine and land elements that are key to the livelihood of nearby communities as well as their sense of identity. Since it was coined, there has been positive engagement with the term, so much so that the concept has extended into the imaginary and folklore territory where communities engagement with tales of mermaids are being brought into the matrix of aquapelago.******The original definition of aquapelago introduced by Philip Hayward specified their applicability to island communities. Over time, the concept has expanded to consider the role of marine spaces in metropolitan locales, the influences of media-lore on perceptions of the marine environment.******The concept of ""aquapelago"" has expanded from its use by scientists to explore the role of marine elements in island formations to include a consideration of how these elements play into cultural contexts, specifically folklore and media-lore. It has also been applied to metropolitan locales in order to consider how these spaces are imagined and act as collective agents.******The term _aquapelago_ was introduced to the field of Island Studies in 2012. Suwa’s concept is striking in that it conceives of combined terrestrial and aquatic spaces as, effectively, neighborhoods. One significant development of the concept of the aquapelago has concerned the notion of there being an “aquapelagic imaginary.” on mermaids, and mer-cultures."
"Passage: []“Erdoğan’s Long Arm” was caught red handed in Belgium. The Belgian Police detected that the IP address, where threat messages were sent to Turkish journalists via some social media, belongs to the Turkish Embassy in Brussels.The headline news of Het Laatste Nieuws (HLN,) one of the bestselling newspaper in Belgium, on Friday has reported that The IP addresses of the threat messages indicates the Turkish Embassy in Brussels. The prosecutor’s office carrying out the investigation also confirmed the information.The Brussels’ Bureau Chief of the closed newspaper Zaman; Selçuk Gültaşlı and other correspondents were pointed as a target after the controversial coup attempt on July 15, 2016 by twitter users named ‘Veysel Filiz’ and ‘Selim Güzel.’ Veysel Filiz was the Press Consultant of the Turkish Embassy for that time.Turkish journalist R. filed a criminal complaint about the Twitter accounts, which sent posts to be in scope of hate crimes. The investigation has been going on for one and a half year. The Belgian Police’s inquiry focused on the accounts named Selim Güzel (@selimguzel_FC) and Veysel Filiz, the Press Consultant of the Embassy.According to the news of HLN, Zaventem Police informed R. a few weeks ago and said that they detected that one of the IP addresses who was threatening him belonged to the Turkish Embassy. R. took the record as an official report.It is also stated that the prosecutor’s office had a difficult time as the investigation gained a diplomatic character. Therefore, the paper has reported that, the investigation has proceeded very slowly for the last few months because of its political and diplomatic sensitivity. The former press official of the Turkish Embassy was also in a diplomatic status.Jeroen Bosaert, the journalist who signed the news report, called the Turkish Embassy and asked for information. He asked the Embassy officials if they knew anyone called Selim Güzel. But he received a reply that they didn’t know anyone with that name, and that person didn’t work for the embassy either.Nevertheless, Bosaert kept on his search and revealed Selim Güzel’s previous posts on twitter as he was someone working for the Embassy. For instance, on July 27, 2016 he posted “We attended Europe Islamophobia Summit in Sarajevo. We were with Volkan Kocagül from our Ministry of the EU. The topic is dimensional, I will write about it.” And Volkan Kocagül was a high ranking diplomat at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Journalist Bosaert has reported the contradiction in the Turkish Embassy’s statements, and he highlighted that the twitter user Selim Güzel was occasionally with Turkish ministers and diplomats.R. filed his first complaint about the threats on social media on the next day of the controversial coup attempt on July 15, 2016. The reason was, Veysel Filiz @veysel_FILIZ tagged R. and posted “Do not rejoice so soon, we are marking your lairs.”Journalist filed his second complaint in September 2016 for Selim Güzel.

"Passage: []Under the heading, “be careful what you wish for, you might just get it,” the satisfaction Democrats, other leftist organizations and their media allies derived from President Donald Trump’s decision to disband the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, may be short-lived.Not that they get it — yet. Thus, the reliably feverish Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reiterated the Left’s tiresome tropes that ensuring the integrity of American elections constitutes “a front to suppress the vote” and an effort to “perpetrate dangerous and baseless claims.” Schumer further insisted the Committee’s disbandment demonstrates that “ill-founded proposals that just appeal to a narrow group of people won’t work, and we hope they’ll learn this lesson elsewhere.”Schumer’s assertion that protecting elections resonates solely with a “narrow group” is laughable. A 2015 CBS News poll revealed a majority of Americans considered voter fraud to be fairly widespread, and a 2016 Gallup poll revealed a whopping 80% of Americans favor requiring voters to provide _photo ID_ to cast a ballot. Moreover, a 2007 Gallup poll _and_ a 2012 Washington Post poll both revealed more Americans are concerned with voter fraud than voter suppression.So why did Trump shut down the Commission? “Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry,” Trump said in a brief statement last Wednesday. “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.”Leftists will likely regret the shift and fittingly, they have only themselves to blame. As columnist Thomas Lifson explains, Democrats made so-called Russian hacking of the election “a national security issue. This opens the door for DHS — armed with far more investigatory power than any commission might exercise — to go full bore at election fraud,” he writes. “President Trump tried it the nice way, only to encounter obstruction. Now it is time for Plan B, and I am pretty sure that Democrats will not like it at all.”Kobach, who led the Commission along with Pence, was equally explicit. “What’s happening is a tactical shift where the mission of the commission is being handed off to Homeland Security without the stonewalling by Democrats,” he stated. Kobach also hammered reliably leftist organizations like the ACLU and the NAACP, along with congressional Democrats and their Commission members, who attempted undermine its work at every turn. “They have absolutely no interest in stopping voter fraud,” Kobach declared. “It’s truly extraordinary that one party in our system has made clear that they don’t care.”The most critical aspect of the change? Leftists who often use the courts to get what they want (or prevent that which they don’t) will no longer have that option. “The investigation will continue. And it will continue more efficiently and more effectively,” Kobach warned. “By throwing their food in the air, [Democrats] just lost their seat at the table.”At least eight lawsuits have been filed against the Commission, largely based on accusations that asking for state voter data, much of which is on the public record, violated open-records laws, or breached privacy protections. Moreover, Democrat Commission member and Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed his own lawsuit, accusing the commission of hiding information from him. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly partially agreed, saying the panel should provide him the requested documents.Despite the commission being disbanded, Dunlap insists it still has to honor the judge’s decision. “I didn’t want to go to court,” he told The Daily Signal. “All I wanted, honest to God, was to participate and get an answer to all of my questions.”Dunlap was also concerned about the change of course. “How many driver’s licenses has Homeland Security issued?” he asked rhetorically. “None. How many elections has Homeland Security run? None.”Despite Dunlap’s take, DHS’s outsider status is a _good_ thing. Driver’s licenses? Twelve states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Vermont and Washington, plus the District of Columbia — allow _illegal aliens_ to obtain driver’s licenses. Of those 12, only Utah favored Trump in the 2016 election. Only three — Washington, Nevada and Hawaii — were willing to provide the Commission with any information.As for running an election, Americans might be shocked to discover that at least 38 states currently or will soon allow voters to register online, and 14 currently or will soon permit voters to register on Election Day. Moreover, according to Ballotpedia, 34% of the states have no ID requirement to vote, 24% have non-strict, non-photo voter ID laws, 20% have non-strict, photo ID laws, 6% have strict, non-photo ID laws, and 16% have strict, photo ID laws.In other words, there is ample opportunity to commit voter fraud.Nonetheless, Democrats would have Americans believe lax registration and voting procedures, coupled with wholesale resistance to investigations, has a non-existent or marginal impact on the integrity of elections. Moreover, they insist any effort to conduct an investigation that would either reveal fraud — or the lack thereof that would _validate_ their assertions — amounts to “a wild-goose chase for voter fraud, demonizing the very American voters whom we should all be helping to participate — with the not-so-secret goal of making voting harder with unnecessary barriers,” according to Dale Ho, director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project.That would be the same ACLU whose executive director, Anthony D. Romero, called for the DOJ “to appoint a special prosecutor to independently investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian interference in November’s election and for Congress to create a select committee, akin to the Watergate select committee, to ensure an adequate and public resolution of this crisis” — to “preserve our constitutional values.”Thus, some allegations of voter fraud are “more equal than others.” And despite Democrat denials, the Commission did document 8,471 cases of double-voting in elections in 21 states, and 938 voter fraud convictions since 2000. Moreover, the same Democrats who have issues with the DHS’s current effort to supersede their resistance, had no problem when Obama administration DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson determined that state election systems were “critical infrastructure,” requiring federal oversight due to “hacking” concerns — despite no evidence of hacking.Again for leftists, hacking by extra-national entities is highly problematic, but “hacking” by thousands of potentially ineligible or double voting individuals, including “extra-nationals” (read: illegals), is no problem at all.In short, the Democrat Party’s stance on investigations of voter fraud is highly selective. Any DHS investigations that might prove inimical to their interests amounts to “disenfranchisement,” while any investigation that even hints at delegitimizing the current president — courtesy of a Special Counsel armed with extra-constitutional power — must be pursued with unrelenting vigor.How Democrats miss the searing irony that the special counsel’s investigation provides a powerful justification for the DHS’s investigation is anyone’s guess.Let the proverbial chips fall where they may. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize what the article has to say about voter fraud."	"Schumer asserts that combating voter fraud is a means to suppress the vote. However, voter fraud is considered to be reasonably widespread by the majority of Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has comparatively more investigatory power than the commission, so the investigation will be more efficiently handled.******The article discusses the disbandment of President Trump's election integrity commission. It indicates that voter fraud is a widespread concern in the American population, with more people concerned than not. Although an overwhelming majority of Americans consider voter fraud to be widespread, some leftists insist that voter fraud is not a problem, and argue that efforts to examine the issue are ""disenfranchisement."" As such, despite the disbandment of the Commission, the Department of Homeland Security is asked to step in and pursue investigations of voter fraud.******Schumer asserts that combating voter fraud is a means to suppress the vote. However, voter fraud is considered to be reasonably widespread by the majority of Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has comparatively more investigatory power than the commission, so the investigation will be more efficiently handled.******The article discusses the disbandment of Trump's election integrity commission amid Democratic criticism and reluctance to cooperate with investigations into potential voter fraud. It notes that despite some evidence of voter fraud, Democrats are opposed to attempts to investigate or remedy potential issues. Republicans dissolved the commission due to the resistance from Democrats and potential ineffectiveness, but argue that the investigation will continue through the Department of Homeland Security. The article also highlights several possible avenues for voter fraud, including online registration, voter ID laws and hacking concerns.******The author submits and maintains that voter fraud is a possibility in many states for reasons that the author largely attributes to Democrat policies. Factors like allowing immigrants who don't yet have a legal status in this country to obtain driver's licenses contribute to voter fraud, according to the author. The issue is further problematic because 38 states allow or will allow soon for registering online to vote."

"They are certain their more relaxed policies on registration and procedures does not affect the outcome of elections. The Democrats think the potential hacking by Russians needs a special committee for investigation while asserting that the Republicans are trying to make voting harder. The author posits that the Democrats support all investigations that could discredit their opposition while opposing any that would be inimical to their interests.******The author presents evidence on double voting and voter fraud stats (8,471 cases of double voting in 21 states). The Democrats state that such investigations are discriminating against Americans who are trying to vote and that final results aren't affected. They also state that there is a danger of disenfranchisement if DHS and other government agencies come to check fraudulent voting. The author feels that such fears of investigations are unfounded and selective, citing the Democrats' desire for a special committee to investigate Trump's ties to Russia.******They are certain their more relaxed policies on registration and procedures does not affect the outcome of elections. The Democrats think the potential hacking by Russians needs a special committee for investigation while asserting that the Republicans are trying to make voting harder. The author posits that the Democrats support all investigations that could discredit their opposition while opposing any that would be inimical to their interests.******Democrat politicians and organizations contend their policies on voting procedures are right because they favor more access to the ballot and protections for voters, as compared to ensuring the integrity of the voting process by investigating possible cases of voter fraud.******According to the author, Democrats believe their policies on voting procedures are right because they are concerned primarily with preventing voter suppression, not fraud. Thus, any attempt by Homeland Security to investigate voter fraud, even though such fraud has been documented, would be seen as disenfranchisement by Democrats. Furthermore, Democrats want a Special Counsel to probe Trump's alleged collusion with Russia, and the author finds the Democrats' desire of investigating election integrity to be selective."

Leftists who often use the courts to get what they want (or prevent that which they don’t) will no longer have that option. “The investigation will continue. And it will continue more efficiently and more effectively,” Kobach warned. “By throwing their food in the air, [Democrats] just lost their seat at the table.”At least eight lawsuits have been filed against the Commission, largely based on accusations that asking for state voter data, much of which is on the public record, violated open-records laws, or breached privacy protections. Moreover, Democrat Commission member and Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed his own lawsuit, accusing the commission of hiding information from him. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly partially agreed, saying the panel should provide him the requested documents.Despite the commission being disbanded, Dunlap insists it still has to honor the judge’s decision. “I didn’t want to go to court,” he told The Daily Signal. “All I wanted, honest to God, was to participate and get an answer to all of my questions.”Dunlap was also concerned about the change of course. “How many driver’s licenses has Homeland Security issued?” he asked rhetorically. “None. How many elections has Homeland Security run? None.”Despite Dunlap’s take, DHS’s outsider status is a _good_ thing. Driver’s licenses? Twelve states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Vermont and Washington, plus the District of Columbia — allow _illegal aliens_ to obtain driver’s licenses. Of those 12, only Utah favored Trump in the 2016 election. Only three — Washington, Nevada and Hawaii — were willing to provide the Commission with any information.As for running an election, Americans might be shocked to discover that at least 38 states currently or will soon allow voters to register online, and 14 currently or will soon permit voters to register on Election Day. Moreover, according to Ballotpedia, 34% of the states have no ID requirement to vote, 24% have non-strict, non-photo voter ID laws, 20% have non-strict, photo ID laws, 6% have strict, non-photo ID laws, and 16% have strict, photo ID laws.In other words, there is ample opportunity to commit voter fraud.Nonetheless, Democrats would have Americans believe lax registration and voting procedures, coupled with wholesale resistance to investigations, has a non-existent or marginal impact on the integrity of elections. Moreover, they insist any effort to conduct an investigation that would either reveal fraud — or the lack thereof that would _validate_ their assertions — amounts to “a wild-goose chase for voter fraud, demonizing the very American voters whom we should all be helping to participate — with the not-so-secret goal of making voting harder with unnecessary barriers,” according to Dale Ho, director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project.That would be the same ACLU whose executive director, Anthony D. Romero, called for the DOJ “to appoint a special prosecutor to independently investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian interference in November’s election and for Congress to create a select committee, akin to the Watergate select committee, to ensure an adequate and public resolution of this crisis” — to “preserve our constitutional values.”Thus, some allegations of voter fraud are “more equal than others.” And despite Democrat denials, the Commission did document 8,471 cases of double-voting in elections in 21 states, and 938 voter fraud convictions since 2000. Moreover, the same Democrats who have issues with the DHS’s current effort to supersede their resistance, had no problem when Obama administration DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson determined that state election systems were “critical infrastructure,” requiring federal oversight due to “hacking” concerns — despite no evidence of hacking.Again for leftists, hacking by extra-national entities is highly problematic, but “hacking” by thousands of potentially ineligible or double voting individuals, including “extra-nationals” (read: illegals), is no problem at all.In short, the Democrat Party’s stance on investigations of voter fraud is highly selective. Any DHS investigations that might prove inimical to their interests amounts to “disenfranchisement,” while any investigation that even hints at delegitimizing the current president — courtesy of a Special Counsel armed with extra-constitutional power — must be pursued with unrelenting vigor.How Democrats miss the searing irony that the special counsel’s investigation provides a powerful justification for the DHS’s investigation is anyone’s guess.Let the proverbial chips fall where they may.

"Passage: MARY EGGERS TENDLER (née EGGERS) is a volleyball coach and former volleyball player. She is the head volleyball coach at Elon University[1] and played collegiately for Illinois where she was a First-Team All-American and winner of the Broderick Award (now the Honda Sports Award) in 1989 as the nation's top collegiate female volleyball player.[2]Early lifeEggers was born to Warren and Shirley Eggers and grew up in Aurora, Illinois with four older brothers and sisters. She shot basketballs in her driveway in the evening, and when her older sisters would return home with a date, she would challenge the dates to a hoop contest. Even though she was ten years old, she would challenge them in her pyjamas and usually beat them, picking up a little pocket change.[3] She started playing volleyball in eighth grade, when her pastor persuaded her to join a team.[4][5] She attended West Aurora High School, where she played both basketball and volleyball, but she improved her volleyball skills and was named a high school All-American. In her senior year, she helped lead the team to the state supersectionals.[6]While at high school, she played basketball and volleyball for her first three years, but then decided to concentrate on volleyball, and only played volleyball as a senior.[7] In her senior year, the was named the Chicago Sun-Times Girls Volleyball Players of the Year.[8] She considered several schools in the area, including Northwestern, Illinois State, Western Michigan and Illinois. However, while all three schools other than Illinois were ranked in the top 20 in the nation, she decided to go to Illinois.[9] It wasn't because of their strength as a program, the team was 15–18 the year before she arrived, and 5–25 the year before, but she felt Illinois was a “team on the rise” and she wanted to be part of it.[10][11]CollegeEggers led the nation in hitting percentage in her sophomore and senior years, 1986, and 1988. She was named to the First-Team All-Big Ten team all four years of school, and was named an All-American three times.[12] Her career hitting percentage, .420, was tops in the nation and stood as the top mark until 1993.[13] She helped lead the team to their first ever NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament in 1985, and helped the team reach the final four in 1987 and 1988.[14][15] In 1989, her senior year, she won the Honda Broderick Award as the nation's top collegiate female volleyball player.[16][17]ProfessionalEggers played a year and a half with the Olympic team, then played professionally for two years in Germany and France.[18]CoachingShe began her coaching career as an assistant coach at Illinois State, Drake and James Madison.[19] She became the head coach at Elon University in 2002.[20] In 2010, she was named the SoCon Coach of the Year as the best coach in the Southern Conference.[21][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What would have happened if Eggers did not join Illinois?"	"If she had not joined Illinois, she may not have been named an All-American three times, and may not have won the Broderick Award. Without her, the team possibly would not have gone on to their first ever NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament in 1985 and reached the final four in 1987 and 1988."
"Passage: It was a chilly spring day in Vancouver. “Hurry up we have to get going to the town center soon, breakfast is downstairs,” Adams wife stood at the bedroom door. She had dark black hair that drooped down her face and pale white skin much like Adam. He got up out of bed to change into his black jumpsuit; the same jumpsuit that everyone wore except his had a unique number, it read 77689. Towards the bathroom, he walked with a slouched back and a slight limp following a factory accident he had a month ago. A feeling of anger came over him but quickly subsided; he remembered the doctor telling him to control his thoughts and emotions.  “Breakfast looks good,” he said with a cold smile, it was a hot metal bowl of oatmeal and honey. The same food everyone got for their rations, the government provided the food, everyone got equal treatment. At the table sat Adams only son Tim, a gaunt ghoulish boy with razor-sharp cheekbones and hollow eyes.    “I hate this food,” Tim said spinning his spoon around the bowl, making a horrid screeching sound.   “Stop that,” his mum groaned looking as equally fed up of the cuisine.  “Don’t complain about the food, we should be thankful that we’re eating a hot meal,” Adam insisted, something inside of him didn’t feel right but he carried on slurping up the oatmeal. He looked past the drab and grey walls into the window where the sun stood far out of reach. “Let's get going, we don’t want to miss the news,” Adam sighed, as he got up the old wooden chair screamed being dragged across the wood floor.   The door creaked open as the family stepped out, the smoke-filled air heated up Adams throat drying it up like an Arabian desert. His lungs now used to the air no longer rejected it instead suffered from every burning breath. The taste was like burning hair which dried up the mouth. Stark houses stood only meters apart to accommodate the growing population. Now at the Town Center, he looked at the posters which hung up on telephone poles ‘Vote for Venessa Cooper 2078’, the same burning anger from earlier crept up his insides but like a fire extinguisher was put out by an irrational wave of fear. The endless sea of people stood around them, a flowing river of bodies. EEEEEEE the siren screeched, and silence quickly came to take its place. The silence hung in the air like a heavy fog but was disturbed by a flash.   “This is not your daily news broadcast, we call ourselves M0XERS,” the huge screen which usually displayed the news now projected a man with a deep monotone voice. He looked different as his face was not gaunt but was instead colourful and round, he had a dark brown beard that resembled a rainforest, his bare head scrunched up when he spoke. “We are here to liberate you from the prison you live in,” he declared, his tone so serious but warming. All eyes were on the screen then a group of dark masked figures abseiled down the screen. As people watched in curiosity the red paint quickly made out the word ‘freedom’.  The heavy silence was pierced by the yelling and hissing of people chanting “This is the hate of the old age!” The man on the screen looked in horror, suddenly the door behind him opened with a loud bang. Flashing white was followed by the sound of gunshots and screams. Silence once again covered the town center like a blanket of fog, when the dust cleared all that was left were bodies. A soldier dressed in all white appeared on screen then all went blank.   “We need to get out of here,” Adam said as he pulled his family away from the sea of people. Gunshots could be heard as a large military truck the size of two school buses plowed through the group of masked individuals. Gas was thrown at the crowd to disperse them. Everything slowed down, it felt as if someone stabbed him and pulled out his stomach. People were running and screaming as people began getting caught in the crossfire, he looked back and froze.   Breaths began coming to him but only in slow rattling gasps. His breathing would stop only to emerge like a drowning victim coming up for their last breath. His family still life clawed out of them into the cold hands of death. He looked at the word freedom now barely visible, covered in blood like a 1st graders painting.   “Go home or you will be shot!” the speaker blasted; this startled all the people still frozen in place to run like birds from a rock. Adam ran to in fear of his life, was he a coward to do so he thought. Nausea clawed at his throat he felt a strong contraction in his stomach, a vile acidic taste filled his mouth as he looked down only to see vivid yellow bile with chunks of oats.   The door creaked open and the coldness from the house felt like nails down his spine. His crying was both ferocious and noisy. He blinked briny tears from bloodshot eyes, his thick lashes stuck together in clumps as if he'd been swimming. The tears made wet tracks down his face and dripped from his stubbled, wobbling chin. He lay down needles sliced through every inch of his body the pain was too much, his eyes felt heavy like warm blankets.  He let his consciousness ebb away into the escape which was the darkness.    Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the feelings the characters in the text have about the food served to them."	"Adam's reaction to the food is ironically the ""same"" as his son's - it tastes bland. Adam's wife, who is also not pleased with the food, seems beset by an air of futility as she exclaims that they should be grateful they are eating hot food. ******Adam's wife is fed up of the food, and Adam's son complains about the food. Adam's lungs stopped rejecting inhaling the air and his appetite was along way from healthy. Parts of the story suggest that the food is from the government which is how everyone gets food. People are unhappy about the food, it is not appetizing.******Adam's son feels frustration and anger about eating the same food every day. Adam's wife admonished the family to be grateful for having access to a hot meal."

There was panic and fear - the main character ran away in terror, vomiting up his breakfast in nausea.******The MoXERS' revolution message alongside the violence wreaked by the masked soldiers fueled fear and a feeling of powerlessness in the people present.

As he moved his head closer he noticed the fibers were woven from a variety of colors like, red, blue, and yellow. But as he pulled his head back he no longer saw the colorful strands. Instead, the colors blended together into the murky, grayish\-brown he was having trouble classifying. To pass the time he experimented with this nearsighted phenomenon by calculating how far he had to dip his head until the colored fibers became visible. After a few dips and withdraws, he determined he had to lower his head to about chest height before he could see anything but gray with a sad smear of brown. It was at that moment he also realized how foolish he must have looked to the others in the room. Normal people were occupied with their Instagram feed or a 6\-month old issue of Consumer Digest. Why couldn’t I just be normal, he thought. Why couldn’t I be anywhere, but here, he thought. He picked his head up and rearranged his shoulders. Now he stared at the administrator who was seated behind a sliding glass window. The glass window was closed and the administrator had his head down. Thank God, he thought, no eye contact.Behind the administrator was a large, Master Edwards clock. It sat high enough that even if the administer were to sit upright, the entire clock face would still be visible to anyone on the other side of the sliding glass. Whoever mounted the clock must have considered the possibility that the administrator could obstruct the view of the clock face while sitting upright and therefore placed it at the appropriate height. These were his thoughts while he waited.“Mr. Blocker?”He heard his name, but didn’t move. He maybe thought he’d only imagined someone calling his name and didn’t want to appear anxious, so he sat still.“Mr. Blocker? Are you Mr. Blocker?” the attendant called out. She was standing in an open doorway in the far righthand corner of the room. She was looking directly at him. Finally, he made eye contact with someone.“This way please.”He rose to his feet and stuffed his hands in his trouser pockets. He took his first steps toward the door, feeling a bit defeated by the carpet. He was still unclear on its color. The attendant lead him down a white corridor. The walls were white. The ceiling was white. The floor was white, linoleum tile. The lighting was soft, fluorescent white. He decided to stop focusing on the color white and let his mind drift to something more pleasant, the lining of his trouser pockets. He’d always been quite satisfied with the navy suit he was wearing. The shoulders fit him perfectly. The taper of the legs was trimming and made him look taller. But the lining of the trouser pockets is what pleased him most. The lining was a soft silky material that felt fine and glossy when he rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger. “Right in here please”, the attendant directed. Her arm was outstretched, half of it inside of another room. This room was his room. This room was where he was supposed to go. He was sure of it. Not because the attendant declared it so, but because it felt right. He pulled his hands out of his pockets and entered.In the middle of the room was a large desk. It appeared to be very old and extremely heavy. Probably oak, he thought. Behind the desk sat a man with wire\-frame glasses. The man was staring at a computer screen. The man was at least twice his age. He could see the glare of the screen almost entirely in the man’s glasses.“Please Mr. Blocker. Have a seat.”He did as he was told and took a seat in a chair on the opposite side of the desk.“Mr. Blocker, we are going to have to make a very difficult decision today.” He sat in his seat and listened.“It’s my opinion that further treatments are not going improve your health.”He extended his chin and began to nod his head. Not to appear as if he was listening, but to communicate that he understood the weight of the declaration the man in glasses had just made.“You’ve been fighting this…we’ve been fighting this for almost ten years. After five surgeries and countless rounds of chemotherapy there has been only very little progress. Of course, we could continue treatment, but your quality of life would rapidly deteriorate and the burden of cost would fall entirely on your next of kin. I sincerely believe it would be best to begin getting your affairs in order. As of today, I would estimate that you may have only a few months left.”He sat silently with his chin still pointed toward the man with glasses. He thought about his wife. He thought about his daughters and their children. He thought about his parents who had passed many, many years ago. He thought about the white corridor with the white ceiling, the white, linoleum tiles and the white, fluorescent lights. He thought about the lining of his trouser pockets. He thought about the carpet.“Taupe!”“I’m sorry Mr. Blocker. I don’t understand,” said the man with glasses.“Gray mixed with a tinge of brown. Taupe.” he replied.He couldn’t think of anything else to say. Instead he furrowed his brow, dipped his head, and regarded the taupe carpet with a newfound sense of familiarity and confidence.He felt more comfortable now, having identified the mysterious color that had been eluding him. So, he lifted his hands to his face, covered his eyes with his sweat palms, and began to cry. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about how the narrator handles his impending death?"	"He cries.******Initially, he sits silently as he thinks about his family. His thoughts drift to other mundane things, including the color of the carpet. Having identified the color as taupe, he says this aloud to the doctor. He then breaks down in tears."

Clayton was previously the deputy clinical director of the National Eye Institute.Early life and educationClayton is a native of Washington, D.C. and attended Catholic school.[1][2] In 1984, she received an undergraduate degree in natural sciences with honors from Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University.[3] During her undergraduate studies, she took dance classes at Peabody Institute, volunteered at the Johns Hopkins Hospital neonatal unit, and worked for the psychology department. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.[4] Clayton earned a medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine. She completed a residency in ophthalmology at the VCU Medical Center. Clayton completed fellowship training in cornea and external disease at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital and in uveitis and ocular immunology at National Eye Institute (NEI).[5]CareerClayton was the deputy clinical director at NEI. She was appointed associate director for research on women’s health at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and director of the Office of Research on Women’s Health at NIH in 2012. Clayton has strengthened NIH support for research on diseases, disorders, and conditions that affect women. She is the architect of the NIH policy requiring scientists to consider sex as a biological variable across the research spectrum, a part of NIH’s initiative to enhance reproducibility, rigor, and transparency. As co-chair of the NIH Working Group on Women in Biomedical Careers with NIH Director Francis Collins, Clayton also leads NIH’s efforts to advance women in science careers.[6]ResearchA board-certified ophthalmologist, Clayton’s research interests include autoimmune ocular diseases and the role of sex and gender in health and disease. Clayton has a particular interest in ocular surface disease and discovered a novel form of disease associated with premature ovarian insufficiency that affects young women, setting the stage for her interest in rigorous, thoughtful exploration of the role of sex and gender in health and disease. She is the author of more than 80 scientific publications, journal articles, and book chapters. Her clinical research has ranged from randomized controlled trials of novel therapies for immune-mediated ocular diseases to studies on the development of digital imaging techniques for the anterior segment.[7]Awards and honorsClayton has received several awards and has been recognized as a leader by her peers. She received the Senior Achievement Award from the Board of Trustees of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in 2008, was selected as a 2010 Silver Fellow by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, and won the European Uveitis Patient Interest Association Clinical Uveitis Research Award in 2010.

"Passage: TAIPEI -- California-based Applied Materials, the world's top chip and display equipment maker, has ordered staff to halt all deliveries and servicing for China's biggest LED chip maker, who was named on a red flag list recently issued by the U.S. government.Xiamen San'an Optoelectronics is one of at least three Chinese customers of Applied Materials who were identified on the U.S. government's ""unverified list,"" people with knowledge of the situation told Nikkei Asian Review. While the list does not embargo dealings with these entities, it requires American companies to treat them with caution. U.S. suppliers can no longer use existing licences to sell them products or service installed equipment, but have to reapply for new ones. San'an Optoelectronics is also the world's biggest LED chipmaker by revenue and listed in Shanghai.Xi'an Jiaotong University, one of China's top 15 colleges, and a unit of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's top research agency, are also Applied Materials customers named on the unverified list, which was published on April 11, a supply chain source familiar with the move said. Some 37 Chinese companies and research institutions were named on the list, as well as seven organizations in Hong Kong, four in the United Arab Emirates, two in Malaysia and one in Indonesia.The U.S. government's move marks another setback to the companies and research institutions who are crucial to China's ambitions to become a global tech superpower.Applied Materials supplies almost all the world's leading semiconductor and panel manufacturers. Market leaders such as Intel, Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and China's national display champion BOE Technology Group could not make products without the company's tool and services.As an industry leader in advanced tools for the critical semiconductor industry, Applied Materials' decision to immediately stop all business with those on the list could influence other U.S. vendors, as well as those outside the country, industry sources told Nikkei.On April 12, Applied Materials sent a notice to all staff involved with the named companies that they should ""immediately stop all pending and future equipment delivery, and cease all service activities at their sites,"" according to the notice obtained by Nikkei. The U.S. chip tool giant also demanded that staff, contractors and other personnel immediately withdraw from the sites of those companies, the notice said.The notice warned that failure to follow this compliance could lead to significant violations of U.S. trade law.The company's actions come just weeks after Applied Materials' CEO Gary Dickerson traveled to China in late March to attend SEMICON China, one of the industry's biggest events and an important showcase for Chinese technology ever since Beijing made chip industry development a top policy priority in 2014.At the event, Dickerson made his first clear and public statement about the U.S.-China trade tensions which have hit the chip industry hard. ""The strained relationship between China and the U.S. can put decades of economic growth at risk,"" Dickerson said. He also warned it would be ""a lose-lose proposition"" if the world's two biggest economic powers were unable to get along.Applied Materials generated some 26% of its revenue from China, its biggest market, in the most recent quarter ending Jan. 27. The U.S. company did not immediately respond to a request for comments. San'an also did not respond to the request for comments.China's commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng last week hit back at the new unverified list, saying the U.S. move could harm Chinese companies' reputation and disrupt normal trade activities. Beijing said it objected to the abuse of national security and export control rules and demanded the U.S. withdraw the new curbs as soon as possible.Akin Gump, an international law firm, warned companies in a research note that they would have to respond to the requirements of the unverified list. ""As a result of this development, U.S. and non-U.S. companies and others should update their internal control program screens to ensure compliance with the new requirements,"" the research note said.Harry Clark, a partner with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP in Washington, told Nikkei that being added to the unverified list does not mean a broad ban on U.S. exports and re-exports to the entity, but it would need to obtain extra licences and file additional reports if dealing with such entities. It also applies to foreign persons.""My firm advises clients to be especially careful to ensure that any export or re-export involving an unverified list entity is scrupulously compliant with the regulation,"" Clark said._Nikkei staff writer Lauly Li contributed to this report._ Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What is the purpose of the U.S red flag list?"

"Passage: June 30, 2019 / 3:24 PM / CBS NewsLast decade, when American was embroiled in the Iraq War, a high-ranking U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put her career on the line to stand up to some of the most powerful men in America. She believed that a major corporation had been benefiting from a collection of well-connected contracts that were costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.Although she was warned against it by supervisors, she blew the whistle on national TV in front of a Senate committee. ""My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to voluntarily appear at this hearing,"" she addressed the committee.Bunny Greenhouse was an unlikely whistleblower. In 2005, Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  ""When I took my oath of office it said that you will conduct the business of contracting impartially … and with preferential treatment toward none. I saw preferential treatment toward KBR,"" she told ""Whistleblower"" host Alex Ferrer in ""Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."" KBR was Kellogg Brown and Root — back then, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the oil services firm Halliburton.  In the weeks prior to the invasion, Greenhouse learned that KBR was being considered for a massive no-bid contract known as Restore Iraqi Oil, or RIO.""What was the size of this contract?"" Ferrer asked.""Seven billion dollars,"" she replied.What Greenhouse didn't know is that even more powerful forces may have been involved.""A lot of attention fell on Dick Cheney, the vice president, and the fact was that he had been the head of Halliburton for … six years,"" Vanity Fair journalist Michael Shnayerson explained. ""So, the suspicion began to grow that perhaps Cheney was steering government contracts to KBR.""A spokesperson for Dick Cheney told CBS News that the former vice president severed all ties with Halliburton and KBR in the summer of 2000 when he became candidate for vice president.  A representative for KBR said ""it's unfortunate that misinformation and myths about KBR's role in supporting the military in Iraq continue to be circulated. These assertions have repeatedly been shown to be false.""For Greenhouse, biting her tongue was never an option. ""I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career,"" she told the Senate committee.A 2004 government report decided the RIO contract was properly awarded. But the Army eventually split up the contract and, as Greenhouse had requested from the beginning, opened it up to competition.  ""Eventually, your enemies at the Army Corps of Engineers caught up with you,"" Ferrer commented.""I felt that I was physically being threatened,"" Greenhouse replied. ""They set up a booby trap that caused me to fall,"" she added.Born and raised in Rayville, Louisiana, Greenhouse and her six siblings grew up poor in the segregated south. Her parents instilled in her and her siblings a strong sense of morals, integrity and honor; no excuse for being less than the best. In the 1960s, she became the first African American teacher at the newly integrated Unity H.S.In 1997, she accepted a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She was hired by Lt. General Joe Ballard and was the first African American woman to become the head of contracting within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Greenhouse started to notice a ""good ole boys club"" forming again at USACE after her boss and mentor, Lt. General Ballard, retired in 2000. Then, in the weeks leading up to the Iraq War in 2003, she attended a top-secret meeting at the Pentagon to discuss details of the Restore Iraqi Oil contract. Present in the room were representatives of Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, Cheney's former employer. Greenhouse was concerned about awarding KBR with the no-bid, 5-year contract and urged to accept other bids and limit the duration of the deal. But her objections were never addressed, and KBR received the contract. Later, it was revealed in a draft audit that the company had overcharged the government for fuel purchases by $61 million. She ultimately testified in front of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the Army Corp and she was incredibly good at her job. Because the top brass at USACE couldn't actually fire her, which was a perk of having a high station in the government, they demoted her. When this happened, she was stripped of her security clearance and sent off to a remote cubicle somewhere; she was basically condemned to oblivion. After she filed her whistleblower lawsuit, someone placed a trip wire placed around her cubicle and she fell, permanently damaging her knee.The Defense Authorization Act Of 2009 reformed some of the very contracting practices that Greenhouse had objected to five years earlier and it limited the duration of certain no-bid contracts.Greenhouse filed a mixed case lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Army Corps of Engineers. The whistleblower case claimed that Greenhouse had been retaliated against for speaking out and had faced discrimination based on race, age, and gender. In July 2011, she agreed to a settlement of $970,000.------------------------------------------------------------------------_""Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers""__ aired Friday, June 28 at 8/7c on CBS.  _ Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about KBR?"

"Passage: June 30, 2019 / 3:24 PM / CBS NewsLast decade, when American was embroiled in the Iraq War, a high-ranking U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put her career on the line to stand up to some of the most powerful men in America. She believed that a major corporation had been benefiting from a collection of well-connected contracts that were costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.Although she was warned against it by supervisors, she blew the whistle on national TV in front of a Senate committee. ""My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to voluntarily appear at this hearing,"" she addressed the committee.Bunny Greenhouse was an unlikely whistleblower. In 2005, Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  ""When I took my oath of office it said that you will conduct the business of contracting impartially … and with preferential treatment toward none. I saw preferential treatment toward KBR,"" she told ""Whistleblower"" host Alex Ferrer in ""Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."" KBR was Kellogg Brown and Root — back then, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the oil services firm Halliburton.  In the weeks prior to the invasion, Greenhouse learned that KBR was being considered for a massive no-bid contract known as Restore Iraqi Oil, or RIO.""What was the size of this contract?"" Ferrer asked.""Seven billion dollars,"" she replied.What Greenhouse didn't know is that even more powerful forces may have been involved.""A lot of attention fell on Dick Cheney, the vice president, and the fact was that he had been the head of Halliburton for … six years,"" Vanity Fair journalist Michael Shnayerson explained. ""So, the suspicion began to grow that perhaps Cheney was steering government contracts to KBR.""A spokesperson for Dick Cheney told CBS News that the former vice president severed all ties with Halliburton and KBR in the summer of 2000 when he became candidate for vice president.  A representative for KBR said ""it's unfortunate that misinformation and myths about KBR's role in supporting the military in Iraq continue to be circulated. These assertions have repeatedly been shown to be false.""For Greenhouse, biting her tongue was never an option. ""I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career,"" she told the Senate committee.A 2004 government report decided the RIO contract was properly awarded. But the Army eventually split up the contract and, as Greenhouse had requested from the beginning, opened it up to competition.  ""Eventually, your enemies at the Army Corps of Engineers caught up with you,"" Ferrer commented.""I felt that I was physically being threatened,"" Greenhouse replied. ""They set up a booby trap that caused me to fall,"" she added.Born and raised in Rayville, Louisiana, Greenhouse and her six siblings grew up poor in the segregated south. Her parents instilled in her and her siblings a strong sense of morals, integrity and honor; no excuse for being less than the best. In the 1960s, she became the first African American teacher at the newly integrated Unity H.S.In 1997, she accepted a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She was hired by Lt. General Joe Ballard and was the first African American woman to become the head of contracting within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Greenhouse started to notice a ""good ole boys club"" forming again at USACE after her boss and mentor, Lt.

"Passage: He had always wondered what it would feel like to die.Going into the War, watching his friends and comrades fade from this world, watching them fall before bullet and disease, like wheat before a scythe, he had wondered how it would feel to leave this world: screaming or silent; in pain or at peace; begging for mercy, or cursing and hateful.It was a curious thing, to think about one’s own demise; to be aware that one’s life will, inevitably, end. Yet still he pondered, even as he fought in the trenches, bullets and dirt flying past his face, how it would feel to simply... go.But now he knew, as he gazed across the horizon watching the waves of heat rising across the baked sand, his feet as heavy as he trudged across the barren land, that this is Death.Death is not pain, not agony, not fear and hurt followed by a gentle, caressing, descent into a blissful and endless sleep. Nor is Death sadness and regret, a time of rueful reflection as you say everything you wished you had said, to those you wished to have said it to. Nor, for that matter, is Death peaceful, a gentle, tranquil time where you can simply pass, at peace with the knowledge that you have accomplished that which you were able.No, Death is none of these things. These feeling, these thoughts, were reserved for the time before Death. But in Death, in the final seconds before one’s life ends, there is but one thing you feel, and one thing only:Weary.Indeed, that is how he felt, as sand caked his face and wormed its way into his eyes and mouth, simply, weary.He did not feel regret; though he knew he should’ve held his wife just that little bit tighter, given her just one more kiss, told her he loved her just one more time.He did not feel anger; he did not beat against the ground and scream Why? Why me! The world would carry on without him, and there was naught that fear and hate would accomplish.He did not feel sadness; but he might have had he known he was a father.No, he felt none of these things. These were not the thoughts that occupied the mind of the man in the throes of death, for his weariness encompassed everything, enveloping him in a blanket of emptiness, smoothing over the highs and lows of his emotions, and leaving nothing but a blank, flat, smooth slate.He would die out here, indeed, he was in the final minutes, the last seconds, of his life. He cared not what would come after; he had never been a religious man, but knew that he would deserve whatever came. Nor did he dwell on what had come before; he had done his duty to his country, served it to the best of his ability. He had loved his wife with all his heart, and cared for his mother and father, even when they no longer recognized his face.No, he saw no reason to dwell on any of these things. All he felt was his skin burning, slowly, as the merciless sun beat down on him. And his weariness, so constant, so unwavering, that it had become like a weight upon his back.One which, eventually, brought him to his hands and knees, panting, and sweating on the sand. Distantly, he felt a drop drip down his nose, tickling him . It reached the end and clung there, on the tip of his nose, before dripping off. He watched it, seeing it fall, before falling himself.He had heard that in the final moments a person’s life, their entire life flashes before their eyes. He waited, expecting this slideshow of memories to appear at any moment, in the hope that he would be able to see his wife’s face just... one more time.His eyes closed, he waited.His body limp, he waited.Weary to his bones, he waited. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What is the protagonist's sentiment about death?"	"He does not feel any of the feelings that are usually associated with death, such as pain, agony, fear, or sadness. He only feels weary."
"Passage: There was once an old homeless man who lived on the corner of fifth and first, in a frigid alleyway that resembled underground Bangkok. Cluttered with heaps of trash and feces from the locals. It was nicknamed The Devil’s Taint by the crack-addicts that dwelled in its air of despair. This old man was a heron addict has been for 12 years since he lost his job as a news anchor. Wife left him for the best man at their wedding, DeMarcus. She took the kids to Costa Rica so they would forget he ever existed. Yeah his life was in a real shitter. He would try to fix himself up and get his life straight. Every time he tried a black lab would come to keep him company, but would leave if he picked up a needle. The dog reminded him of the fortune he once had and lost at a snap of a finger. Happiness…Today’s the first of June, and the homeless man was ready for his Katabasis. He’s been preparing for weeks by now. The sun begins its descent down the horizon, and with its departure, arrived a familiar face. The black lab he adored. The dog approached him and laid its head on his lap, then fell asleep. With a smile on his face, he looked at the heavens and somehow felt at peace. Time passed, hours to days, days to weeks, and weeks to months. It was around December when the tailored man came.The tailored man was in his mid 30’s, a stunning doppelganger to the homeless man’s past. He was in a rush when he scurried past the old man and the dog. Stunned the tailored man turned around to observe the dog. A joyous smiled appeared on his face. He turned to the old man with delight and asked, “How much for this dog?”Startled the old man replied, “He’s not for sale.”“How about $1,000,” protested the tailored man?“No,” the old man yelled.“$10,000,” the tailored man rebuttal. “No,” the old man yelled infuriated.The tailored man got down on his knees and begged, “Please I’ll give you a millionaire dollars this dog.”“Why do you want this dog so bad,” the old man asked?‘You see when I was a boy I had a dog named Maverick, who was a black lab. He looked exactly like that dog over there. One day my mother got sick of him and decided to let him go in the woods. I cried for weeks because I lost the only person who understood me. And now here I am looking at a clone of him. So please Sir, I’m begging sell me your dog.”The Old man contemplated whether or not to give up the dog. It was a symbol for everything he once had, but with the money he could get it all back.  Thoroughly thought through he decided to sell the dog. The tailored man’s faced lighted up like a virgin who was about to lose his virginity to a cheerleader. He signed a check, handed it over to the old man and left feeling whole again. As for the old man he started over again.Cleaned up and fresh out of rehab he invested his money into nanotechnology, which turned him into a Billionaire. He lived in 10-acre mansion with a 3-acre yard, Olympic sized ground pool and Jacuzzi. He had a trophy wife with a bust of a goddess, and trophy cars to match. This old man had it all, except the dog. The only true serenity he had in his life. Now he’s the tailored man. The empty tailored man.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about life in rehab?"	"The old man is in rehab and is clean and fresh when he invests his money into nanotechnology."

"Passage: POCKET PALMA (sometimes stylized in all lowercase or sentence case) is a Croatian synthwave duo formed in Zagreb in 2012 by Anja Papa and Luka Vidović.[1][2][3] Until 2019, they were known under the name SIDE PROJECT. As Side Project, they have released two albums, _Things Which No One Else Should Know About_ in 2015 and _Lonely Boys_ in 2017.[4][5]In 2018, Papa and Vidović decided to rebrand, replacing dark pop sound with nostalgic synthwave sound of the '80s and starting to make music in their native Croatian.[6] Under the new name Pocket Palma, they released an EP _Godišnji_ in summer 2019.[7] During the same year, they signed a contract with Croatian label Aquarius Records and released their self-titled debut album in Croatian.[8][9]Early beginningsPapa and Vidović met in high school in 2012 and, started making covers of songs by Arctic Monkeys and Guns N' Roses “for fun”.[10][11] They both attended elementary music school, where Papa played the flute and Vidović played the piano. Following their graduation from high school, they enrolled in Faculty of Philosophy on University of Zagreb.[12]In 2013, they released their debut single “Things Which No One Else Should Know About” under the name Side Project, after which they began working on their debut album. In March 2015, they released a music video for their new single “Glitter”, directed by Filip “Philatz” Filković.[13] On 4 September the same year, they released their debut studio album _Things Which No One Else Should Know About_.[14] They promoted the album by holding a concert in Tvornica Kulture, Zagreb on 5 December.[15]In 2016, they released singles “Guns” and “Giving Souls Away”. In June 2017, they released their new single “Second Skin”, inspired by Zagreb Pride 2017. In September the same year, they released the lead single off their sophomore album of the same name, “Lonely Boys”.[16] During the same year, they recorded official soundtrack for Filip Filković's short dystopian film _The Last Well_, which was released in November.[17][18][19] In December, _Lonely Boys_ was released.[20][21]In 2018, Papa revealed they had dropped out of university.[22][23]CareerPapa and Vidović stated that they had spent most of 2018 separated, consequently not knowing how to make music for Side Project together as they both had headed in different directions. They simply “were not inspired to make new Side Project material”. During one of their sessions, they decided to translate one of the songs they had written to Croatian and thought it “sounded cool”.[24] In spring 2018, they composed new music and wrote lyrics about going to the seaside, going out of the city, and summer love in English to it. They said they had decided to try themselves out in synth pop “after Vidović had wandered to Yugoslav synth pop playlists on YouTube”.[25] In the beginning of 2019, they decided to write about the same topics, but in Croatian instead. They released their debut single in Croatian, titled “Godišnji”, under the new name Pocket Palma. In May 2019, they released a mini-album of the same name.[26] Until the autumn, they scored a radio hit “Ono što nam inače nedostaje”.[27]After Pocket Palma's music had been taken down from online platforms, Papa and Vidović announced in October they had signed a contract with Croatian label Aquarius Records.[28][29] In December, they released their debut self-titled album in Croatian for Aquarius. It consisted of all songs from _Godišnji_, as well as four new songs.

"Passage: A short story by Corbin WillmorthI am writing this down now. I know this might sound bad out of context, but I think I have found a new look on how I view life. I mean that I am happy. Like, truly happy. It is all because of this tea that I drank. It is made up Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue.Anyway, I drank this tea, which honestly tasted like shit and made me wanna throw up for the first 30 minutes, and after about 45 or so minutes I started to laugh. I started laughing about fucking everything! I laughed about how huge my pupils were, I laughed at how small my hand looked, I laughed at the movie I was watching (it was the onion movie for those who were wondering), and I laughed at myself. I realized in that moment that I was happy. I was completely shocked at how happy I was. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I was smiling. SMILING! This was the first time in literally a whole year that I had seen myself genuinely smile. I’m gonna get real here for a moment. I’ve had an incredibly shitty year. Literally since day one of 2018. On January 1st, I lost a very dear loved one. My grandma, to get into the spacifics. I lost my mother at a very young age, and most my contact with her family, and my grandmother became my new mother figure. I was always honest, sharing my feelings with her and telling her everything. There are so many things I wish I should have told her. When she died I went into this very deep depression. I pushed away my friends and I just stayed in bed and cried. I just wanted to die and make my feelings go away. It was fucking miserable. I can’t even describe it completely. It was the suckiest of suck I have felt in my life. And then, I moved. I moved 200 miles away from my hometown of Snoqualmie, Washington, a town just 40 miles west of Seattle, to Chewelah, Washington, a small town 80 miles north of Spokane. I moved away from all my friends and family, and it made me even sadder. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any suckier, it did. However, drinking that tea made me realize how much I worried too much. I worried too much about what other people thought of me. I worried too much about what was in my future. I just fucking hated that I worried about pointless shit. Sure, my life was shitty, but I’ve come to realize that it’s all okay. It’s okay that I felt awful, I understand how hard my life was up until this point.It’s December 1st, fifteen days away from my 18th birthday. I think that it is finally time that I moved forward. I need to stop worrying about the past and about the future. I just need to focus on what is happening now. Stop thinking. Just do. Do it. Do what makes you happy. If you love music, start a band, fuck it! If you like writing, write! My point is, just take life at your own pace. Stop stressing over what ever it is that has you so worried. Take time out of your day to think about yourself. Sure, you might want to call me names because I found happiness in drugs, but the point of my, you could call it an essay, was to make a point about that. Yes, DMT made me super fucking happy for like six hours. What I want to do from now on is find things in the real world that makes me happy. I need to stop relying on drugs. I might not quit drugs completely, seeing as how I wanna be a legal marijuana grower (because in the state of Washington you can make over $100k a year by growing weed for a cannabis company). I’ve done drugs, I’ve been there, I’ve seen things. Of all the things I’ve seen, I now know that one thing is clear. I’m happy. I’m happy because I stopped worrying.If you managed to read this whole thing, I would like to thank you. Yes, I am speaking directly to you, the person reading this. Thank you for taking time out of your day. Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I know you must be busy. You have a life, I get it. But you actually took five minutes out of your busy life to listen to some 18 year old hippy talk about his shitty life. Thank you for caring. It’s nice that people care about things. Anyway, it’s 1:29AM right now, I should get some sleep. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What kind of tea did the narrator drink? Why did it make him so happy?"	"The tea was made of Chacruna leaves and Syrian Rue. It made him happy because it caused him to laugh at everything after 45 minutes."
"Passage: The CHICKASHA CHIEFS was the final and a primary name of the minor league baseball teams based in Chickasha, Oklahoma. Playing between 1904–1952, Chickasha teams played as members of the Southwestern League (1904), Western Association (1920–1921), Oklahoma State League (1922) and Class D Sooner State League (1948–1952).HistoryMinor league baseball in Chickasha began when Chickasha briefly had a team in 1904. The SHAWNEE BROWNS of the Southwestern League moved to Chickasha, Oklahoma on June 30, 1904. The team became the CHICKASHA INDIANS and continued play in the Southwestern League. However, the franchise returned to Shawnee, Oklahoma on August 3, 1904. The franchise then disbanded on September 5, 1904.[1][2][3]Baseball returned in 1920, when the CHICKASHA CHICKS began play in the eight-team Western Association. The Western Association had just reformed after a two-year hiatus. Other 1920 league members were the Drumright Drummers, Enid Harvesters, Fort Smith Twins, Henryetta Hens, Okmulgee Drillers, Pawhuska Huskers and Springfield Merchants.[4][5]In their first full season of play, the Chickasha Chicks finished 52–72 (7th) in the 1920 Western Association.[6]The Chickasha Chicks won the 1921 Western Association Championship. The Chicks finished 74–74 (5th overall) in the regular season and captured the first-half pennant. In the playoff Finals, the Chickasha Chicks defeated the Fort Smith Twins 4 games to 3 to claim the 1921 championship.[7][8][9]Chickasha left the Western Association to join the newly formed Oklahoma State League in 1922 and won their second straight championship. Other charter members of the six–team 1922 Oklahoma State League were the Clinton Bulldogs, Duncan Oilers, El Reno Railroaders, Guthrie, Oklahoma and Wilson Drillers.[10][11]Playing in the new league in 1922, the Chickasha Chicks finished 55–55 (3rd) in the regular season. They qualified for the playoffs by winning the first half championship with a 33-17 record.[12] In the second half, however, shaky finances and dwindling attendance during a losing streak caused the team to miss payroll and forfeit several games, culminating with a league takeover of the franchise. The team was renamed the “Orphans” and forced to play its remaining schedule on the road.[13][14][15] Despite limited success over the remainder of the regular season, the team defeated the Clinton Bulldogs in the playoff finals, 4 games 0, to claim the 1922 championship.[16] After the 1922 championship season the franchise folded.[17][18]In 1948, the Chickasha Chiefs began play in the Sooner State League. The Chiefs and Ada Herefords were expansion teams in the league as it expanded from six–teams to eight–teams after forming in 1947. The other 1948 Sooner State League members were the Ada Herefords, Ardmore Indians, Duncan Cementers, Lawton Giants, McAlester Rockets, Pauls Valley Raiders and Seminole Oilers.[19][20]Chickasha qualified for the playoffs in 1948. The Chicks finished 73–63 (4th) in the regular season. In the playoffs, the McAlester Rockets defeated the Chickasha Chiefs 3 games to 1. The Chiefs 1948 attendance was 35,640, an average of 524 per game.[21][22]Returning to the playoffs in 1949, the Chickasha Chicks finished 78–61 (3rd) in the regular season. In the 1949 playoffs, the Lawton Giants defeated Chickasha 3 games to 0. The Chicks 1949 attendance was 59,306, an average of 853.[23][24]The 1950 Chickasha Chiefs finished 80–59 (3rd) in the Sooner State League regular season. Qualifying for the playoffs, the McAlester Rockets defeated the Chiefs 3 games to 0. The 1950 season attendance was 43,759 (3rd in the league).[25][26]In 1951, the Chickasha Chiefs used five managers in finishing 46–94 (7th) in the Sooner State League. The 1951 season attendance was 21,107.[27]The Chickasha Chiefs returned to the Sooner State League playoffs in 1952. The Chiefs finished 78–62 (3rd) in the 1952 regular season. In the playoffs, the Pauls Valley Raiders defeated the Chickasha Chiefs 3 games to 1. Season attendance: 27,494, an average of 393.[28][29]the Chickasha Chiefs folded after the 1952 season and were replaced by the Gainesville Owls in the 1953 Sooner State League. Chickasha hasn't hosted another minor league baseball team.[30]The ballparksThe Chickasha Chiefs played at MEMORIAL PARK, also referred to as BORDEN PARK. Borden Park burned in August 1950 and was rebuilt for the following season.[31][32] The ballpark had a capacity of 1,700 (1950) and 2,500 (1952). Borden Park, which is now called Elliott Field and is used for high school baseball, was located at 200 North 19th Street.[33]From 1920 through May 1921, the Chickasha Chicks played at UNIVERSITY PARK.[34] University Park, which had previously hosted exhibition games featuring Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson, was located at the terminus of the street railway line near present-day Shannon Springs Park.[35][36][37]In the middle of the 1921 season, the Chicks moved to a newly constructed ballpark named GRADY FIELD. The new ballpark was located on East Choctaw Avenue, just east of the viaduct that carries that road over the railroad tracks, where the Grady County Fairgrounds are now located. University Park was demolished immediately upon completion of the new field.[38][39][40]The 1904 Chickasha Indians played at ROCK ISLAND BALL PARK.[41] This facility was built at the site of the former Rock Island stockyards, south of the Rock Island Railroad machine shop and the Crystal Ice Company plant, on land donated by the railroad.[42][43][44][45] The location was half a block east of South First Street, along the railroad tracks between East Minnesota and East Dakota Avenues.[46]Notable alumni-   Ed Cole (1950)-   Mike Cvengros (1921)-   Camilo Pascual (1951) Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame-   Ned Pettigrew (1920, MGR)-   Pete Runnels (1949) 5× MLB All-Star, 2× AL batting champion (1960, 1962), Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame-   Guy Sturdy (1921)[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the successes of the Chickasha baseball teams."	"The Chickasha Chicks were successful in 1921 winning the Western Association. They were also successful the following year winning the Oklahoma State League. They qualified multiple times for the playoffs but won only twice. Chickasha also was successful again in 1966 playing in the Southwestern League beating the Duncan Oilers.******The Chicks won the 1921 Western Association Championship and won the Sooner State League championship in 1922. However, the team folded after the 1952 season.******The 1921 Chicks were successful, winning the Western Association Championship. This could be considered a success.

"Passage: Voices from the television, white noise to *his* vacant mind. Two men were talking to each other and *he* didn't see their faces. *He* saw moving lips. The stench of the apartment did not bother *him*. Half eaten food rotted on the floor. The most recent of this food was a bowl of somewhat eaten jello. It sat still on the table next to the couch where a mindless *man* sat. Who is this man?

This writer is a genius. But at this moment, he isn't a famous writer. He is Alfred Jones, the newest of his characters.

He jolted wide awake. *Is it midnight?* He checked the time through a TV and found it was 9:00. Two men were talking on a screen. *Who are these two men, Sally?* He looked around. Sally was not there. *This isn't my place. Did I get drunk today? No, I couldn't have. So how did I get here?* The man stood up, puzzled by what was happening. *The jello will stink, the jello will stink.* He was startled by this incoherent thought. It wasn't his. *Who was that?!

This isn't him! This isn't him! *WHO IS THIS FACE?! WHO IS THIS?!* He screamed and screamed. He clawed at the face. *Is it a mask?* He pulled but it wouldn't come off. *Stink jello stink.* The man smashed the face into a mirror. He's just dreaming right now! *This can't be real.* Blood trickled down the mangled face. Shards of mirror were dug into skin. They were deep. *Where's your wallet?* I don't know. *Go find it.* Who are you?The man walked of a bathroom. Blood dripped onto a floor. *Why is my face on fire?* The man went towards a room.

Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Why is the protagonist behaving in such a self-destructive way?"	"The protagonist is behaving in self-destructive ways because he believes he is trapped in an alternate reality. In this alternate reality, he believes his face is on fire and that he is someone else- specifically Stephen King. He does not remember putting himself in a trance to create his newest character for his book, Alfred Jones. This confusion has driven him to behave erratically in order to escape this alternate reality.******The protagonist is behaving in such a self-destructive way because he appears to be experiencing delusions brought on by some sort of break with reality. He has put himself in a trance where he is living as his newest character, Alfred Jones. He goes to the bathroom and upon looking in the mirror sees a mangled face that is not his own. He then picks up a wallet and sees the name ""Stephen King"" on the identification, leading him to believe that he is that author. The pain in his face combined with his delusions leaves him entirely disconnected from reality, prompting him to scream and smash things. This detachment from reality also leads him to destroy himself.******He is likely attempting to expel the character attributes of Alfred Jones, the newest character for his book.******No answer."

"Passage: A short story by Corbin WillmorthI am writing this down now. I know this might sound bad out of context, but I think I have found a new look on how I view life. I mean that I am happy. Like, truly happy. It is all because of this tea that I drank. It is made up Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue.Anyway, I drank this tea, which honestly tasted like shit and made me wanna throw up for the first 30 minutes, and after about 45 or so minutes I started to laugh. I started laughing about fucking everything! I laughed about how huge my pupils were, I laughed at how small my hand looked, I laughed at the movie I was watching (it was the onion movie for those who were wondering), and I laughed at myself. I realized in that moment that I was happy. I was completely shocked at how happy I was. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I was smiling. SMILING! This was the first time in literally a whole year that I had seen myself genuinely smile. I’m gonna get real here for a moment. I’ve had an incredibly shitty year. Literally since day one of 2018. On January 1st, I lost a very dear loved one. My grandma, to get into the spacifics. I lost my mother at a very young age, and most my contact with her family, and my grandmother became my new mother figure. I was always honest, sharing my feelings with her and telling her everything. There are so many things I wish I should have told her. When she died I went into this very deep depression. I pushed away my friends and I just stayed in bed and cried. I just wanted to die and make my feelings go away. It was fucking miserable. I can’t even describe it completely. It was the suckiest of suck I have felt in my life. And then, I moved. I moved 200 miles away from my hometown of Snoqualmie, Washington, a town just 40 miles west of Seattle, to Chewelah, Washington, a small town 80 miles north of Spokane. I moved away from all my friends and family, and it made me even sadder. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any suckier, it did. However, drinking that tea made me realize how much I worried too much. I worried too much about what other people thought of me. I worried too much about what was in my future. I just fucking hated that I worried about pointless shit. Sure, my life was shitty, but I’ve come to realize that it’s all okay. It’s okay that I felt awful, I understand how hard my life was up until this point.It’s December 1st, fifteen days away from my 18th birthday. I think that it is finally time that I moved forward. I need to stop worrying about the past and about the future. I just need to focus on what is happening now. Stop thinking. Just do. Do it. Do what makes you happy. If you love music, start a band, fuck it! If you like writing, write! My point is, just take life at your own pace. Stop stressing over what ever it is that has you so worried. Take time out of your day to think about yourself. Sure, you might want to call me names because I found happiness in drugs, but the point of my, you could call it an essay, was to make a point about that. Yes, DMT made me super fucking happy for like six hours. What I want to do from now on is find things in the real world that makes me happy. I need to stop relying on drugs. I might not quit drugs completely, seeing as how I wanna be a legal marijuana grower (because in the state of Washington you can make over $100k a year by growing weed for a cannabis company). I’ve done drugs, I’ve been there, I’ve seen things. Of all the things I’ve seen, I now know that one thing is clear. I’m happy. I’m happy because I stopped worrying.If you managed to read this whole thing, I would like to thank you. Yes, I am speaking directly to you, the person reading this. Thank you for taking time out of your day. Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I know you must be busy. You have a life, I get it. But you actually took five minutes out of your busy life to listen to some 18 year old hippy talk about his shitty life. Thank you for caring. It’s nice that people care about things. Anyway, it’s 1:29AM right now, I should get some sleep. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about drugs?"	"The writer started drinking a tea made of Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue, and it made him happy.

She was born in Boston and briefly lived in the Philippines between 1972 and 1975 before her family fled to Canada.[1] Her parents were both influential in the Filipino community in Toronto, laying the groundwork for what is now the Filipino Centre Toronto.[2]She attended Havergal College then McGill University, where she received her Bachelor of Science degree in psychology and women's studies in 1991.[3] When she graduated, she became an intern at the United Nations, moving to Vienna to work with the UN Industrial Development Organization supporting developing countries.[4] Through that experience, she became interested in international health.[5]She then received her Master of Health Science degree in health promotion at the University of Toronto and continued securing internships through the United Nations, including one with the International Conference on Population and Development.[6]De Villa then decided to go to medical school, receiving her medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1998. She completed her residency in public health and preventive medicine. She later received a Master of Business Administration from the Schulich School of Business at York University.CareerIn 2004, de Villa began her almost thirteen year tenure at the Regional Municipality of Peel Office of Health, where she ultimately became the medical officer of health, serving from October 2015 to March 2017. There, she worked on a number of public health issues, including vaccination and prevention of communicable diseases, such as sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis.[7] She also oversaw the region's air quality and food and water safety.[8]On March 27, 2017, de Vila began her term as the medical officer of health at Toronto Public Health after the retirement of David McKeown_._[9] She was appointed for her evidence-based approach to public health.[10] In this role, she has worked to combat the opioid epidemic in Toronto, advocating for a series of policies to expand public health services. Her recommended policies include the creation of a safer drug supply to reduce the need to buy drugs off the street, better support for under-served populations, and decriminalizing drugs.[11] In 2019, she has pushed back against budget cuts proposed by the Progressive Conservative provincial government under Premier Doug Ford, which would limit Toronto's resources for fighting the opioid crisis and other public health programs.[12] She has also criticized the administration for defunding supervised injection sites, which have reversed a significant number of overdoses since opening.Under her leadership, Toronto Public Health has worked to combat misinformation around vaccine safety and has advocated for advertisers and social media platforms to clamp down on misleading anti-vaccination information.[13] She was also behind the call to ban vaccine exemptions because of religious or philosophical beliefs, though the government would still allow medical exemptions.[14][15] Toronto has seen a steady rise of such exemptions and are working to proactively prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.Since Toronto saw its first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, on January 25, 2020, de Villa has been leading the city's response to the emerging pandemic.[16] Her office issued a number of recommendations to the mayor of Toronto, John Tory, to lock the city down as much as possible, advocating that measures stay in place for 12 weeks from April 1, 2020.[17] Tory has also set a fine of $1,000 for those convicted of violating social distancing guidelines of maintaining a distance of 2 meters or more.[18] De Villa has also used her authority under the _Health Protection and Promotion Act_ to order all individuals with COVID-19—as well as those who have been in contact with confirmed cases—to remain home for 14 days.[19]De Villa sits on the McGill Women, Leadership & Philanthropy Board, working to increase the representation of women in positions of leadership, governance, and philanthropy.[20]Awards and Honours-   Distinguished Leader Award, McGill Toronto Excellence Awards, 2019[21]-   Naimark Award, Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement, 2013[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about life expectancy in Toronto after de Villa became the medical officer at Toronto Public Health?"

"Passage: (Title pending)The parked looked rather desolate; the weather was oppressive. There weren't any children playing, no mother tending to their young; there was nothing captivating about it. However, I still remember how green the grass was, the laughter of the children, soccer moms walking their dogs, but mostly, I remember her. Her green eyes, her elegance, and the way her hips swayed to and fro when she walked. The way her long black hair would look when the wind picked up and the way I laughed whenever she dropped something. Every day at 10 a.m., I would see her perched on the park bench reading a book or a magazine of some sort. She'd sit there for about an hour or two, and then she would leave without anyone turning their heads but mine. It was as if I was that creepy kid in your math class who'd always stare at you whenever you got up to sharpen your pencil. My eyes were locked onto her and disappointment would wash over me whenever I lost sight.  This routine continued for many months, and she hadn't noticed me for I had said not a single word. I was never going to, because I didn't want to ruin the perfect image I had of her. It was better to admire from afar. Better to be unseen than noticed I thought. But some nights I'd wish I said something to her, just one word like hi. Still I didn't. It was my fear of rejection and what is she thought I was weird or creepy? What if she noticed I stared at her? All of these questions running through my mind and I could've said something, but I didn't.On those I walked back to my place to think. Once I got home, the pungent smell of cigarettes filled up my nostrils and for some odd reason, everything seemed pointless:  My life, my career as a writer, my love life, evens my cat's life. So, I just began to wallow in my self-pity until I fell asleep. It's better if I don't go tomorrow I thought to myself. I lacked the gumption to ever talk to her so why should I go? But that night I had a dream that she spoke to me - she sounded beautiful - and that's all I remember. I woke up and jumped out of bed, took a shower, and put on my best dress. Then, I continued to run to the park maybe the dream was a sign that she was going to be mine. I bumped into people. I might’ve bumped into an old lady, but I didn’t care. After 20 minutes of people yelling at me and frantic running, I arrived at the park just after 10 a.m., and I saw her - she was the first person I noticed, but she wasn't alone.  She was with a man - most likely her husband - and two children. They all looked happy - no troubles in the world. It was a bittersweet moment because she looked so happy when I have always seen her look so forlorn. After standing there for two minutes, I walked away and at that moment, I felt my whole world fall apart - piece by piece.On my walk home I wondered if there was any animosity brewing between them – maybe he cheated and she secretly hates him, or maybe they just look happy and they’re planning to get a divorce. An overwhelming sense of false hope came and went away when I knew all of it wasn’t true. She’ll be there tomorrow I thought. I know she will.After that I never saw her again - she never sat on her bench or read a book or a magazine of some sort. I felt empty inside without the sight of her. And day after day I waited for her to come back. She never did and I came to terms with it. She wasn't coming I shouldn't worry if she ever does, but an emptiness still lingered in my heart. Then I had another dream that was edifying. In my dream, I desperately looked for her, hoping to fill the emptiness in my heart, she had to be there. I finally noticed her, stunned by how beautiful she looked. She had a little black dress on with shoes that complemented it so very well. She had red lipstick on and she did her hair in a perfect little bun. Oh, how I wish you could've seen her. She looked beautiful. Then, she said, ""it's only life, darling,"" then she leans in and plants a kiss on my lips. She was gone. I never dreamt of her again. She was out of my life; out of my head. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about the narrator's inability to approach and talk to the girl in the park?"	"The story doesn't explicitly explain why the narrator doesn't approach the girl in the park. It seems that there are two possible reasons for the narrator's inability to speak to her. The first reason being that he is afraid of her. He thinks that she might find him weird or creepy. He might think that she would ask him why or how he was able to keep staring at her without her noticing him. Another reason why the narrator is reluctant to approach her maybe because he wants to admire her from afar. He considers himself to be in love with this beautiful girl but does not act upon it. Instead, the narrator has the tendency to think about how the girl would feel about being noticed by him.

Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about the possible messages hidden in the narrator's dreams about the girl?"	"The narrator dreams about the girl because he still feels connected to her yet she was gone from his reality. He believes there must be something more to the dreams, perhaps a deeper message about the girl and their relationship. It may be a sign that the girl might come into his life or that they could have a future together. Whatever it is, the dreams beg the question of what could have been had he said something to her at the park.******The narrator's first dream where the girl spoke to him was probably meant to show him that she was already spoken for and happy with her life. The next day the narrator saw the girl a man, possibly her husband, and two kids. They all looked so happy, with no troubles in the world. The narrator's second dream was probably meant to tell him ""that's life"" and he should move on with his.******The dreams suggest that the narrator misses the girl and their brief time together had an impact on him. The dreams are a reflection of the emptiness in the narrator's life without her in it and also highlight the regret and confusion he feels in light of her absence.******The narrator dreams about the girl because he still feels connected to her yet she was gone from his reality.

"Passage: Tick....Tick....Tick...That old clock still has my number. The cats eyes go back and forth, but they're always watching me. From the kitchen, to the living room, and though the walls seperate us, I can feel it watching in the bathroom. Shampoo bottles half empty, my blow dryer and bubble bath. I don't need these things, but I need to take them. I picked a few empty boxes from the grocery nearby, but havent filled up one yet.Tick....Tick...If I just sit on the floor..no, if I lay actually, I can see the colors of the curtains and couches swirling around. I'm not high yet, nothing to drink this early, and still I'm spinning. I want to rip the books off of the shelf and hurl them at the TV, but then I won't have the white noise. Maury or something is playing, they're about to find out if some guy is the father to a child of a loud woman. I hope he's not.     If I get up now, and start collecting and packing, I'll likely feel a sense of accomplishment, that's what I've been primed to believe, but what really will be done? I'll have moved on from a place of comfort, even if it has grown less familiar. I'll be carrying my things, physical and emotional, from block to block, searching for a new place to put down my baggage. Who does that help, and what does it accomplish?     Maybe I'll just leave it all. Who needs these things; pots and pans, frilly curtains and polished oak poles. If I'd spent less time picking them out, maybe I wouldn't feel so conflicted. What do I need from here anymore, and what did I need from here to begin with? I'm wondering if I ever felt truly at home here, or if I bought these accessories to distract myself from an empty feeling I've always had inside these walls. Tick....Tick...If I step onto the balcony and look below, I can see the flower garden meant to be cared for by this floor, the apartments above and below, and mine.

Should I take the plates and silverware? I could just buy more, but I did pick these out specifically because they matched our dining room walls and table.

The clock is still watching though, so perhaps I'll just send a postcard from my new life.    'Love From Sunny Somewhere, Wish You Were Here!'And I do, wish you were here.

"The narrator's latest move is not for her home but for her relationship, and she wonders if it's really worth packing if she's leaving her husband behind. Her first instinct is to feel like she's accomplished something, but she doesn't know what's been accomplished. She wonders why she's moving on and why her sense of being at home has slowly drifted away. She regrets not throwing away the plates and silverware, but also realizes she wanted them to match the dining room. Thus, she resolves to leave most of her stuff.******The narrator packs half-empty shampoo bottles, a blow dryer, and bubble bath in the bathroom. Ever since she found out her husband cheated on her, the narrator believes she'll feel a sense of accomplishment if she gets up and starts packing. She considers leaving everything behind.

In the end, she decides to just leave everything behind and move on, but she takes the clock with her. ******They think it would be good to go.******The narrator tries to rationalize whether or not she should pack her belongings and move on, or leave everything behind to her cheating husband. She acknowledges that everything being packed holds meaning to her, while still being conflicted about the act of packing itself.

"Passage: [in n out employee pay]Employees at In-N-Out Burger start at a higher-than-average salary of at least $13 an hour. Adam Lau/AP-   IN-N-OUT BURGER PAYS ITS EMPLOYEES REALLY WELL.-   STORE MANAGERS EARN AN AVERAGE YEARLY SALARY OF MORE THAN $160,000, MORE THAN WHAT THE TYPICAL TECH WORKER IN SILICON VALLEY MAKES FOR THE YEAR.-   HIGH WAGES FOR FAST-FOOD WORKERS CAN LEAD TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY, LESS EMPLOYEE TURNOVER, AND BIGGER PROFITS IN THE LONG RUN.------------------------------------------------------------------------There's a secret sauce to In-N-Out Burger's success. It pays employees really well.The West Coast burger sensation pays store managers an average yearly salary of more than $160,000, which is about triple the industry average, according to the latest California Sun newsletter. There is no college degree or previous management experience required.To put this into perspective, tech workers in Silicon Valley earn on average $114,654 for the year, according to a survey from hiring platform Dice.""In-N-Out is just eons above everybody else,"" Saru Jayaraman, an advocate for restaurant workers in the Bay Area and director of the Food Labor Research Center at UC Berkeley, told California Sun's Mike McPhate. ""On wages and benefits, they really are the best large chain.""Employees start at a higher-than-average salary of at least $13 an hour and have the opportunity to advance to six figures as a store manager. A typical architect in California makes about $112,000 a year, while a lawyer rakes in $117,000, according to jobs site Indeed.[]Employees at In-N-Out Burger say they're more satisfied than others at tech giants like Google and Microsoft. Melia Robinson/Business InsiderThe burger chain offers benefits including 401(k) plans, paid vacation, and dental and vision coverage for part- and full-time employees — a rarefied package in the fast-food industry. In a Glassdoor ranking of the best places to work in 2018, In-N-Out earned the No. 4 spot and beat out tech giants like Google and Microsoft. It was the only restaurant chain in the top 50.Denny Warnick, vice president of operations at In-N-Out, told California Sun that paying employees well has always been part of the company culture. In 1948, Harry and Esther Snyder opened the first In-N-Out in a Los Angeles suburb with quality service as a central focus. ""Paying their associates well was just one way to help maintain that focus, and those beliefs remain firmly in place with us today,"" Warnick told California Sun.It's not an act of charity, according to Jayaraman. Her research shows that paying employees well leads to better productivity, less employee turnover, and bigger profits.In-N-Out is growing. The burger chain recently announced it's opening a distribution center in Colorado, which could allow it to expand beyond the West Coast. All stores must be located close to these hubs because of the company's strict policy of serving food fresh, not frozen.LoadingSomething is loading.[]More: BI Innovation In-N-Out Burger Fast Food Industry SalariesChevron iconIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What is remarkable about the pay packages of In-N-out burgers?"	"The fast-food restaurant pays its workers really well. Store managers earn $160,000 per annum, this is more than the average architect, lawyer or Silicone Valley tech worker. New employees start on $13 per hour. Managers don't need a college degree or previous management experience. They can work their way up the ranks. ******In-n-out burgers offer generous salaries, bonuses and benefits, which are standard in big companies, however in this case they are paying them to employees who work in a fast food joint. Part of the explanation offered is that the employees who work there would be happy with such compensation, hence increased productivity, less employee turnover and, subsequently, bigger profits."
"Passage: Champagne, chardonnay and second-rate vodka. The descent into Vanity Heights was a perfect contradiction. Darcy’s den was full of promises. The promises of allure, freedom, revelry. The promises of power and powder, regret, addiction. But the promise that Vanity Heights fulfilled best was not Darcy’s own. It was the promise flashed upon the television, upon the computer screen, canonised on the glossed pages of magazines. The expectations of how teenager life should be; the expectations, up until this night, crushed by education and responsibility. This was the promise that led Darcy’s guests down the stairs. Down the stairs into Vanity Heights. The house had transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room, when she arrived. “Celeste!” he exclaimed, prancing over to her, a stick of addiction in one hand and a glass of hobby in the other. She gave a long hug, a short conversation and an expected question. With a customary smile, Darcy gave to her an expected bottle of answer. The party raved on, yet the revelry was muted by the brick wall that barricaded Celeste from the action. The rhythmic dripping of the basin tap was the only music Celeste had, yet she chose to reapply her face instead of dancing. She wanted to dance, though, and she knew Darcy would be waiting for her, so she rushed through her routine. She clasped onto her 50mL glass friend, already thrice-used, even though she had been in the bathroom only five minutes.         The drink was downed within seconds of being poured; the liquid sunk to her stomach. She could feel the warm tendrils, cooing words of friendship, branching through her chest, her stomach and finally, finally, back up to drown her mind; pulling her further from the world and closer to her weekend friends.         Six doses later, to finish the bottle, and she was ready to join them. No one ever really knew why she was there. Good school, great grades, aspirations of business and law. Nevertheless, she was soon jiving and twisting and dropping on the floor, with Darcy and other men: around them and in their laps; their hands hoping to get in hers.  Her beholder lay seemingly dormant in her stomach; though its dark tendrils were tightening, strengthening their grip on Celeste, controlling her like a puppet with tangled strings. She thought the overseer a friend, a protector, but her body knew better.Celeste mapped her escape as soon as she felt it. Up the stairs, out of Vanity Heights, past the kitchen, into the garden bed just by the backdoor. She pushed through the crowd. Darcy saw her leave; he knew why, but he didn’t follow.  He never did. By the time she reached the stairs, the beast had revealed itself. A kraken, furious as red, limbs thrashing about inside of her, fighting desperately for an escape. Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. ‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.Whilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  ‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. The stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. ‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. ‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Why did Celeste leave the ballroom so quickly?"	"She was drunk and about to throw up so she ran outside, but didn't make it, she threw up all over the steps and herself. "
"Passage: It was called Zulu. A cheap-ass, sun-faded, rusted-over excuse of an amusement park stuck just outside a notorious ghetto right off the freeway.  No shit. Zulu.  I kid you not; the motif was *jungle adventure*. Fiberglass lions and gorillas lurching about. Man-sized tribal masks announcing the park rules. Plastic trees and a couple of pock-marked rubber crocodiles floating in the unnatural electric blue water of a concrete pool. Are you ready for the mascot? Yes, you got it - a saucer-eyed, cartoon pygmy with a bone through its nose and hair like it just stuck it's dick in an electrical outlet. Cutouts of Zinger-Zu in front of every ride telling kids how tall they had to be....  So egregious, it soared right over ""unacceptably offensive"" and landed square on ""ironically acceptable kitsch."" And it was located in Dallas County, Texas, so that helped.  Virgil had been born into the ghetto that sprawled behind the zig-zag shadows of Zulu's dilapidated roller coasters. As a very young child, that park represented the promise of magic, adventure and mystery. Of course, money being money, he'd never been allowed to visit during those innocent years; and you grow up fast in the ghetto, so by the time Virgil actually did get to pass through the wrought iron gates for a sample of jungle paradise, he was already too old to believe in voodoo or hippopotamuses. No, as a pre-teen and teenager, he went to Zulu exclusively to buy weight and sell dime-bags to suburbanites from Fort Worth.  He'd never had the chance or, later, the inclination to ride a single ride.  \*\*\*  Older now, Virgil had lived 35 years, married twice, and had four kids. He stood six foot two inches, still trim at two hundred pounds. He had a good job in the city; a respectable house in the suburbs. His current girlfriend was able to trick him into church on Sunday mornings because she knew how to handle him on Saturday nights. If he wasn't careful, she'd become #3.  He was driving down the freeway with his youngest son, Wayne, and the child made a curious noise when they passed the almost illegibly weathered sign for ""Zulu! Live the Adventure!""  ""What?"" Virgil asked his boy.  ""Zulu...,"" the child said. ""Zoo?""  ""Nah."" Virgil laughed. ""But good guess. Hey, you know....""  Virgil checked the mirrors and exited the freeway. ""You want to live the adventure, little man?""  \*\*\*  Wayne's mother was crazy. Not quite rising to the level of court mandated institutionalization, but Virgil figured that was only more bizarre road-rage incident away. Nevertheless, for all her batshit inclinations, she was very smart. Once she'd told Virgil that her IQ had been tested in the genius level. And he believed her. But, really, what did it matter if you could mentally convert ounces to grams or recite poetry from memory if you couldn't buy a dress without getting into a vicious fight with the saleslady, knocking over the window display, and getting chased out of the mall by a team of rent-a-cops?  Virgil was well rid of that situation; but he enjoyed spending time with their child. The boy seemed to have acquired his mother's intelligence, with none of the insanity. Virgil supposed it was bad form to pick favorites, but of all his children, Wayne was the only one he actively troubled himself to spend time with. All the others were dropped off by mandate; but Virgil would go out of his way to pick up Wayne and gladly hold on to him an extra couple of hours or even an entirely unscheduled day when the situation called for it.  Wayne was Virgil's little man. He was a calm, thoughtful, observant and sharp child. His soft, brown eyes took in everything, then his brow would furrow or his smile would widen depending on the situation, and then he'd react in a delightfully mature and appropriate manner. It gave Virgil a sense of peace and rightness, walking hand in hand with his little man.  Just as they did passing through the gates of the Zulu amusement park together; Virgil having purchased two tickets to spend some time reliving his past and sharing the experience with his son.  \*\*\*  ""I used to come here pretty much every night when I was a teen,"" Virgil told Wayne. They were strolling down the market street, past the arcade, souvenir shops, and overpriced food stands. All the buildings were in need of paint and repair - the wood beam facades were chipped and rutted, sporting plenty of graffiti, and the roofs that were supposed to be thatched with palm-leafs had large bare sections of corrugated metal shining through. ""It hasn't changed much,"" Virgil said, sadly.  As they continued through the park, Virgil would offer to take Wayne on some of the rides - Voom Voom Vulture! Zambizi Zinger! Python Plunge! - but the boy judiciously shook his head to the negative. It wasn't fear, just common sense. Everything looked so rickety and sketchy; even if the cabs didn't fall off their disintegrating rails, it certainly didn't look like much fun to be jerked around in those rusty metal buckets for three minutes of bad track.

"Passage: There has never been a sharp distinction between the public and private faces of DONALD TRUMP, who described Atlanta as “crime-infested” online and called African countries “shitholes” behind closed doors. Both sides are about the same, when he is away from the teleprompter and going off script. There is only so much filter that can be removed when there’s hardly any filter to start with. Still, it was somewhat shocking to see Trump talking openly Thursday about something he has so far kept private: imposing the death penalty for people caught dealing drugs. “Some countries have a very, very tough penalty—the ultimate penalty,” Trump said wistfully at a White House summit on the opioid crisis. “And, by the way, they have much less of a problem.”We’ve seen this one coming: In April, Trump called President RODRIGO DUTERTE to praise his bloody crackdown on drugs in the Philippines, which has reportedly killed as many as 12,000 people. “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” he said, referring to Duterte’s extrajudicial, state-sanctioned murder program. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.” The idea apparently stuck with Trump: Last week, Axios reported that Trump has continued privately raising the possibility of executing drug dealers, as Singapore does. “He says that a lot,” one source recalled. “He says, ‘When I ask the prime minister of Singapore do they have a drug problem [the prime minister replies,] ‘No. Death penalty.’”Senior adviser KELLYANNE CONWAY essentially confirmed the report when she clarified that Trump was merely referring to bringing capital murder charges against high-volume dealers of drugs like fentanyl, which, she pointed out, “are so lethal in such small doses.” On Thursday, Trump brought the idea out into the open, suggesting that the United States adopt “the ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.The president’s comments fit a pattern of authoritarian rhetoric, from calling Democrats “treasonous” for not applauding his State of the Union address to pressuring the Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents. But they also suggest a looser, less controlled Trump as the president has grown increasingly frustrated with the shackles his chief of staff, JOHN KELLY, has imposed on him. The chains began to break last month, as Kelly’s authority was rocked by allegations of domestic abuse involving his second-in-command, ROB PORTER. The scandal created a domino effect in the White House that fueled tensions between Kelly and JARED KUSHNER over Kushner’s security clearance and was a factor in the resignation of HOPE HICKS, one of Trump’s closest confidants.The silly season has, in turn, fed a bumper crop of crazy coming out of the Oval. Trump is reportedly considering firing National Security Adviser H.R. MCMASTER, whom he also resents, and on Thursday bucked the advice of his National Economic Adviser GARY COHN and announced tariffs on steel and aluminum, causing the stock markets to plunge. For months, Trump’s senior staff had slow-walked his enthusiasm for a trade war. This week, he decided he would act unilaterally. “Trade wars are good, and easy to win,” Trump tweeted Friday morning, as the Dow Jones dropped another 350 points. This is what it looks like when the president stops being nice and starts getting real. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize everything relating to the author's opinion of Donald Trump."	"The author describes Trump as having a public and private face, and that there is only so much filter that can be removed when there's hardly any filter to start with.

It was conceived as “a document not a documentary”,[1] and the performance was shot in New York City in December 1996, in an abandoned used clothing store on 14th street.[2] Over the course of the performance, simple props and set pieces are varied, such as a bare lightbulb and a tomato sculpture, and occasionally a passerby on the street glances in.[3]Jonathan Demme met Hitchcock after Demme attended a live show, and offered to direct a live performance video for a song, which was then revised to be a full concert.[4] Demme was inspired to film in the storefront setting by a Hungarian theatre group, Squat Theatre, who operated in New York City in the 70s and 80s and typically performed in a storefront against a large plate glass window facing the street.[5]Demme subsequently cast Hitchcock in small roles in two other films, _The Manchurian Candidate_ and _Rachel Getting Married_, and used one of his songs in _The Truth About Charlie_.[6]SetlistAll songs composed by Robyn Hitchcock.1.  “Devil's Radio”2.  “1974”3.  “Filthy Bird”4.  “Let's Go Thundering”5.  “I'm Only You”6.  “Glass Hotel”7.  “I Something You”8.  “The Yip! Song”9.  “I Am Not Me”10. “You and Oblivion”11. “Airscape”12. “Freeze”13. “Alright Yeah”14. “No, I Don't Remember Guildford”Personnel-   Robyn Hitchcock - vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, harmonica-   Tim Keegan - guitar, vocals-   Deni Bonet - violinReleaseThe film premiered at the SXSW Film Festival on March 19, 1998.[7] It was funded by Orion Pictures just before it declared bankruptcy and was bought by MGM, and did not receive the hoped-for distribution or promotion in the United States.[8] In Hitchcock's words, “when MGM kind of unzipped their stomachs to see what they'd swallowed, they pulled out Orion, and they cut open Orion's stomach. And inside Orion's stomach was wriggling Storefront Hitchcock, a little kind of minuscule million-dollar project that MGM wasn't particularly interested in.”[9] In fact in its original US release it only played in one theater in New York City, Film Forum, for one week starting in November 18, 1998.[10]The film was released on DVD in 2000 by MGM.ReceptionDennis Harvey in _Variety_ said that Hitchcock's “rich, supple voice shines, and his seemingly impromptu between-song patter suggests a pleasing form of mild insanity” also saying that “the songs are the real attraction here, and they provide a good overview of a large personal catalog.”[11] Stephen Holden in The New York Times wrote that the film “captures the sensibility of this smart, quirky folk-rocker in the most appealing possible light”,[12] while Scott Tobias in The A.V. Club wrote that “Demme's relaxed, ego-free direction is a reminder that the quirky humanist behind Melvin And Howard and Married To The Mob hasn't lost his touch”, and “his clean, elegant compositions enhance the intimacy of the performance”.[13] However Douglas Wolk of the Village Voice described it as a “simple but nicely presented document of a middling Hitchcock solo performance”, complaining that “the set list dips generously into his lamest recent material”.[14]Soundtrack[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about Hitchcock as a musician?"	"Demme documented Hitchcock's minimalistic performance, shot inside a storefront. The performances were praised. Hitchcock was also described as having a rich and supple voice, self-amusing between song patter, and being a smart and quirky folk-rocker in the most favorable light.******Hitchcock's performance in the film was praised, with a reviewer saying his ""rich, supple voice shines, and his seemingly impromptu between-song patter suggests a pleasing form of mild insanity"" and that Hitchcock's songs are the real attraction of the film."

"Passage: This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the motets of Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV225-230). However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of _Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden_, BWV 230, one of the “six”.A single CD has the capacity to contain the set of six motets plus some other works. For example, Maasaki Suzuki's 2009 recording with the Bach Collegium Japan on BIS includes _O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht_, BWV 118 (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and _Ich lasse dich nicht_, BWV Anh. 159 (the authorship of which has been disputed).[1] The motets chosen for a particular recording project can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in more interest in recording the piece in question. For example, was not included by John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording,[2] by which time scholarly opinion had re-assessed the work.Recordings have also been made of the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, Wolfgang Helbich recorded _The Apocryphal Bach Motets_, sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).[3][4]Types of choirsChoirs with one voice per part (OVPP) are used in some historically informed performances of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the Hilliard Ensemble's second set,[5] and Konrad Junghänel with the group Cantus Cölln.[6] Philippe Herreweghe's second set uses OVPP for some motets, for example _Jesus meine Freude_, and not others.[7]At least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's Thomanerchor, which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under Günther Ramin in the 1950s),[8] as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the Choir of New College, Oxford.[9]Instrumental accompanimentMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches:-   _a cappella_, that is, without an accompaniment-   instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing _colla parte_-   Basso continuo, or just an organ accompaniment, to provide some instrumental support for the singersSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, BWV 226 orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two oboes, taille and bassoon). There is also a basso continuo provided (separate violone and organ parts) which underlies both choirs.[10] An accompaniment is also specified for _Lobet den Herrn_.[11]La Petite Bande and Bach Collegium Japan, for example, use the orchestration of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_ for the other pieces for double choir. However, _a capella_ performance is long-established tradition,[12] which is also reflected in recordings. The Hilliard Ensemble's OVPP version is mainly _a capella_. They omit the instrumental parts of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, but sing _Lobet den Herrn_ to organ accompaniment.[13]The recordings with continuo accompaniment include The Sixteen's version (the instruments are cello, violone, theorbo, organ) and the second recording by the Monteverdi Choir (cello, double bass, bassoon and organ).[14]HistoryThe first of the motets to be recorded was _Jesu meine Freude_ in 1927. This version was sung in English.[15]AwardsIn 2010, Suzuki and his ensemble were given a French award (Diapason d’Or de l’Année) and a German award (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik) for their recording of Bach motets on BIS.John Eliot Gardiner, who has won more Gramophone Awards than any other living artist, received one for his second recording of the motets with the Monteverdi Choir on SDG. It was one of the 2013 awards, the category being “Baroque Vocal”.Grete Pedersen with the Norwegian choir Det Norske Solistkor won a Diapason d'Or in 2018 for their recording of the motets on BIS.DiscographyThe intention has been to feature versions which are still available. The year given is that of recording. In the case of pre-1980s recordings, the date of reissue on CD can be significantly later than the original recording.Notes[1] [2] _Bach: Motets_ and _Bach Motets_ at .[3] _The Apocryphal Bach Motets: BWV Anh. 159–165_ at .[4] The Sacred Apocryphal Bach (8 CD set) at ArkivMusic website.[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  Accessed via JSTOR (subscription required)[12] Emery, W.

"Passage: First Pet(An unfinished short story by ChillistickCat)We All Have Choices We are under a bush at the foot of a ten foot high hill behind a large concrete sign.  Mother cat is talking to her kittens, who have just recently discovered their abilities to walk and explore, about the dangers of ""street life"" and ""pet life"".   She discusses all of the positive and negative tropes of both lives and tells her kittens they have a choice of which one they wish to live.  Unanimously all the kittens agree that street life, the life mother lived, is the one they want, accept Marko, who remains silent.  They all become quiet, including mother, in a silent stare at Marko. Marko's Unplanned RebellionAfter the litter of kittens disperses to a shady section at the bottom of the hill, Marko makes his way, for the first time, to the top of the hill to a spot where mother cat said never to go as it is precisely the spot where a human can see them and take them.  Not heading his mothers words, he makes his way all the way up to see a vast grid of human houses.  He is in awe of the magnificence of the sight and gazes upon it, wondering what it would be like to be a pet.  He imagines all of the new things he would experience and what a human would be like.  He has seen humans before but never interacted with one.  Until he spots a little human girl in the house closest to the hill.  Just as Mother Warned  She makes direct eye contact with him then immediately points to him, to which two other humans, much larger than she, come into view.  The largest human begins to walk towards Marko.  He does not run away.  He sits and waits for them to come to him. Marko is in awe of how big the human gets as it gets closer and closer to him.  He notices things he has never noticed before, like noses and eyeglasses.  Then, just before he can turn around to look back at his family and mother, large hands embrace his whole body and he is lifted higher then he has ever been.  The motion winds him as he tries to scream for help, but no sound comes out.  Only the sound of the human saying, ""Dont worry little guy, I wont hurt you"".  The words mean nothing to him and he cries once more, this time letting out the loudest shriek he has ever made.  As soon as he gets his bearings inside the large human hands, he looks back to see if his mother heard him.  To his surprise, he sees a vacant hill, and with that he closes his eyes and cries out some more as the large hands place him into a dark box.The Rise of A PetWhen he opens his eyes, Marko finds himself in an unfamiliar world.  He is still inside the box which is now on the floor of a bathroom that is brightly lit by florescent lights.  All he can see is the crack at the bottom of the white door and shadows that move about from the other side.  He exits the box and looks up to find an open window with a long white curtain draping to the floor.  He immediately runs to it and begins to frantically climb until he reaches the window sill.  From this vantage point he can see the hill where he was taken, then he looks down to see a 30 foot drop onto a concrete floor.  He sees a pool and other strange objects laid out about the patio.  He looks back to the hill and now sees his mother atop the hill timidly sniffing the air.  He lets out a loud screech, and his mothers ears perk up in his direction, but her eyes do not follow suit.  He continues screaming to no avail.  She then quickly jumps down the hill out of his sight. Marko tuns around to see the bathroom door has opened and standing in the doorway is the little girl.  She screams, "" Mommy, Mommy, Kitty is trying to escape!"" .  The child's mother then comes running into the bathroom, grabbing Marko, winding him again, and shuts the window closed.Who is Going To Scoop The Cat Litter?(work in process) (work in process)(work in process)(work in process) Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?"

"Passage: First Pet(An unfinished short story by ChillistickCat)We All Have Choices We are under a bush at the foot of a ten foot high hill behind a large concrete sign.  Mother cat is talking to her kittens, who have just recently discovered their abilities to walk and explore, about the dangers of ""street life"" and ""pet life"".   She discusses all of the positive and negative tropes of both lives and tells her kittens they have a choice of which one they wish to live.  Unanimously all the kittens agree that street life, the life mother lived, is the one they want, accept Marko, who remains silent.  They all become quiet, including mother, in a silent stare at Marko.

"Passage: LAST UPDATED: 12 November 2020Australian summers can be tough for people and animals...And while many of us can endure the hottest days with the help of air conditioning and plenty of fluids to keep us hydrated, our wildlife friends can suffer terribly during extreme heat, and even die. Here are 6 ways you can help make the difference between life and death for wildlife during increasingly hot and dry Aussie summers:[Leave water out.]Sweltering summer days can be uncomfortable to be outside in for just a few minutes. Imagine what it is like for animals who have no way of escaping the heat. During heat waves, native animals can suffer terribly and even die — but the simple act of providing them save access to water can help them cope.-   Leave SHALLOW DISHES OF WATER in the shade (try to avoid metal dishes unless they're in full shade as they will get very hot in the sun)-   If you can put some dishes high up/in trees this will help keep wildlife safe from predators. -   Shallow bowls are best, as small birds can become trapped in deep dishes and drown (cat litter trays can actually be quite handy for this reason, and these are often found in discount stores for just a few dollars)-   If you only have large bowls or buckets — be sure to place some large twigs or rocks/bricks inside to allow any trapped animals to make their way out.[Keep dogs and cats indoors.]Not only will this help your animal companions escape the heat, but it will ENABLE THIRSTY WILDLIFE TO ACCESS WATER IN YOUR BACKYARD safely.[Cover your pool.]It may feel counter-intuitive to prevent wildlife from cooling down in your pool on a hot day. But heat-stressed animals looking to cool down are at risk of drowning in pools so taking away that access can actually save lives (it's also not ideal for animals to be drinking pool water as they can get sick).

"Passage: Stephen Thompson wants hometown showdown with Robbie Lawler after UFC NashvilleNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Stephen Thompson is trying not to look past Saturday’s UFC on ESPN+ 6 headliner with Anthony Pettis, but it’s difficult to ignore what’s on the horizon.The UFC heads to South Carolina on June 22 to stage an event in Greenville, where Thompson (14-3-1 MMA, 9-3-1 UFC) resides. Having “Wonderboy” headline the card seems like a natural fit, and he has every intention of taking that spot as long as he’s physically capable.Thompson already has an opponent in mind, too. He’s long pursued a matchup with former UFC welterweight champ Robbie Lawler (28-13 MMA, 13-7 UFC), and he hopes that fight can finally materialize.“Lawler is definitely the fight I’ve been wanting for a while,” Thompson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at UFC on ESPN+ 6 media day. “I’ve been a big fan of him and he’s been such a monster in the welterweight division. I thought he looked great in his last fight with Ben (Askren). He looked really strong and just really focused. I think that year off gave him some time to heal up and get his mind right. I think that would be awesome.“I know there’s a card happening in Greenville, S.C., my hometown, three months from now. Hopefully come out of this fight unscathed and we’ll make that fight happen.”UFC on ESPN+ 6 takes place at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. Thompson vs. Pettis headlines the card, which streams on ESPN+.Thompson said he was close to booking a January showdown with Lawler. However, “Ruthless” said prior to his UFC 235 bout with Ben Askren earlier this month that the matchup was never on the table. Thompson begs to differ, but all of that is in the past, and he hopes they can make it happen in the future.“To us it was (happening),” Thompson said. “The word we were getting is it was happening. It wasn’t until the fight – I was up in New York with Chris Weidman during his fight (at UFC 230) is when I actually found out he was fighting Askren. Up until then it looked like we would fight him. I don’t know if that was UFC or his coaches, I don’t know what the whole plan was there, but for a little while there it looked like it was a for sure thing. But things happen.”The matchup with Lawler, No. 9 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie MMA welterweight rankings, has slipped through his fingers before, and No. 5-ranked Thompson said he hopes it doesn’t happen again. With Tyron Woodley no longer champion at 170 pounds, Thompson has renewed championship aspirations and thinks beating Pettis and Lawler in back-to-back fights would give him a strong case to challenge current titleholder Kamaru Usman.“I think a big win over Pettis is going to put me back in the limelight,” Thompson said. “It’s been almost 10 months since I fought and out of sight out of mind. People stop talking about you, forget about you and I just want to let everyone know that I’m still here. But a win over Lawler – he’s a former welterweight champion. He’s one of the best strikers in the division and has been in the game for a while.“It may not move me up (in the rankings), but it still shows everybody I’m here if I can do what I’m going to do Saturday and fight Lawler in my hometown and prove that, ‘Stephen is still here, let’s give him that shot again.'”For more on UFC on ESPN+ 6, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.Breaking, Robbie Lawler, Stephen Thompson, UFC on ESPN+ 11, UFC on ESPN+ 6, News, UFC Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about why Thompson wants to fight Lawler?"

"Passage: Stephen Thompson wants hometown showdown with Robbie Lawler after UFC NashvilleNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Stephen Thompson is trying not to look past Saturday’s UFC on ESPN+ 6 headliner with Anthony Pettis, but it’s difficult to ignore what’s on the horizon.The UFC heads to South Carolina on June 22 to stage an event in Greenville, where Thompson (14-3-1 MMA, 9-3-1 UFC) resides. Having “Wonderboy” headline the card seems like a natural fit, and he has every intention of taking that spot as long as he’s physically capable.Thompson already has an opponent in mind, too. He’s long pursued a matchup with former UFC welterweight champ Robbie Lawler (28-13 MMA, 13-7 UFC), and he hopes that fight can finally materialize.“Lawler is definitely the fight I’ve been wanting for a while,” Thompson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at UFC on ESPN+ 6 media day. “I’ve been a big fan of him and he’s been such a monster in the welterweight division. I thought he looked great in his last fight with Ben (Askren). He looked really strong and just really focused. I think that year off gave him some time to heal up and get his mind right. I think that would be awesome.“I know there’s a card happening in Greenville, S.C., my hometown, three months from now. Hopefully come out of this fight unscathed and we’ll make that fight happen.”UFC on ESPN+ 6 takes place at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. Thompson vs. Pettis headlines the card, which streams on ESPN+.Thompson said he was close to booking a January showdown with Lawler. However, “Ruthless” said prior to his UFC 235 bout with Ben Askren earlier this month that the matchup was never on the table. Thompson begs to differ, but all of that is in the past, and he hopes they can make it happen in the future.“To us it was (happening),” Thompson said. “The word we were getting is it was happening. It wasn’t until the fight – I was up in New York with Chris Weidman during his fight (at UFC 230) is when I actually found out he was fighting Askren. Up until then it looked like we would fight him. I don’t know if that was UFC or his coaches, I don’t know what the whole plan was there, but for a little while there it looked like it was a for sure thing. But things happen.”The matchup with Lawler, No. 9 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie MMA welterweight rankings, has slipped through his fingers before, and No. 5-ranked Thompson said he hopes it doesn’t happen again. With Tyron Woodley no longer champion at 170 pounds, Thompson has renewed championship aspirations and thinks beating Pettis and Lawler in back-to-back fights would give him a strong case to challenge current titleholder Kamaru Usman.“I think a big win over Pettis is going to put me back in the limelight,” Thompson said. “It’s been almost 10 months since I fought and out of sight out of mind. People stop talking about you, forget about you and I just want to let everyone know that I’m still here. But a win over Lawler – he’s a former welterweight champion. He’s one of the best strikers in the division and has been in the game for a while.“It may not move me up (in the rankings), but it still shows everybody I’m here if I can do what I’m going to do Saturday and fight Lawler in my hometown and prove that, ‘Stephen is still here, let’s give him that shot again.'”For more on UFC on ESPN+ 6, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.Breaking, Robbie Lawler, Stephen Thompson, UFC on ESPN+ 11, UFC on ESPN+ 6, News, UFC Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about the welterweight division?"

"Passage: Since Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in Yemen’s civil war in March 2015, the United States gave its full support to a relentless air campaign where Saudi warplanes and bombs hit thousands of targets, including civilian sites and infrastructure, with impunity. From the beginning, US officials insisted that American weapons, training and intelligence assistance would help the Saudis avoid causing even more civilian casualties.But this was a lie meant to obscure one of the least understood aspects of US support for Saudi Arabia and its allies in Yemen: it’s not that Saudi-led forces don’t know how to use American-made weapons or need help in choosing targets. They have deliberately targeted civilians and Yemen’s infrastructure since the war’s early days – and US officials have recognized this since at least 2016 and done little to stop it.A team of United Nations investigators, commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council, presented a devastating report in Geneva in early September detailing how the US, along with Britain and France, are likely complicit in war crimes in Yemen because of continued weapons sales and intelligence support to the Saudis and their allies, especially the United Arab Emirates.Despite pressure from Saudi Arabia, the Human Rights Council voted last Thursday to extend its investigation.If the council pursues an aggressive investigation based on the 274-page report, the world might finally see some accountability for war crimes committed in Yemen over the past five years. The report’s authors submitted a secret list of individuals who may be responsible for war crimes to the UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, but it’s unclear if that list includes any western officials. The report said third states that have influence on Yemen’s warring parties – including the US, Britain, France and Iran – “may be held responsible for providing aid or assistance for the commission of international law violations”.American complicity in the Yemen war goes beyond providing training and intelligence support, and selling billions of dollars in weapons to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which has become Washington’s largest weapons buyer. The US is looking the other way while its allies commit war crimes and avoid responsibility for instigating the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.[Medics carry the body of a victims allegedly killed in airstrikes carried out by warplanes of the Saudi-led coalition on 1 September.]Medics carry the body of a victims allegedly killed in airstrikes carried out by warplanes of the Saudi-led coalition on 1 September. Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Getty ImagesThe full scope of human suffering in Yemen has been partly obscured because the UN stopped updating civilian deaths in January 2017, when the toll reached 10,000. And while the actual death toll is far higher, many news reports still rely on the outdated UN figures.In June, an independent monitoring group, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, released a report detailing more than 90,000 fatalities since the war began in 2015.In April, the United Nations Development Programme issued a report warning that the death toll in Yemen could rise to 233,000 by the end of 2019 – far higher than previous estimates. That projection includes deaths from combat as well as 131,000 indirect deaths due to the lack of food, health crises such as a cholera epidemic, and damage to Yemen’s infrastructure.Beyond the moral reasons for the US to help end Yemenis’ suffering, the conflict has also harmed American interests in the region. The Yemen war has created new instability in the wider Middle East, and increased tensions between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis and their allies support Yemen’s internationally recognized government, while Iran supports the Houthi rebels, who took control of the country’s major cities in 2014.On 14 September, the Houthis claimed responsibility for attacks on two major oil installations in Saudi Arabia, saying they were retaliation for the Saudi bombing of Yemen. But Saudi leaders and Donald Trump’s administration blamed Iran for the attacks, without providing direct evidence. Trump has threatened to carry out military strikes and impose additional sanctions against Tehran, after he unilaterally withdrew the US from an international agreement signed in 2015 that limited Iran’s nuclear program.For its part, Saudi Arabia quickly invited American and UN experts to help investigate the attacks on its oil facilities. Ironically, Saudi officials have refused to cooperate with most international investigations of their actions in Yemen, including the recent UN report that found the kingdom and its allies likely committed war crimes.Like previous investigations by human rights groups and journalists, the UN report documented how the Saudi-led coalition has killed thousands of civilians in airstrikes; intentionally starved Yemenis as a war tactic; and imposed a naval and air blockade on Houthi-controlled areas that has drastically limited deliveries of humanitarian aid. The report also found that the Houthis likely committed war crimes by planting landmines, deploying siege tactics against several cities, using child soldiers and indiscriminately bombing civilian areas.Despite years of warnings from groups like Human Rights Watch and UN investigations that documented growing evidence of war crimes in Yemen, US officials – first under Barack Obama’s administration and then under Trump – continued to approve weapons sales to the Saudi and Emirati militaries. US officials realized as far back as 2016 that senior Saudi and UAE leaders were not interested in reducing civilian deaths in Yemen, according to two members of the Obama administration who gave little-noticed testimony before Congress in early March.Speaking to the House subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa and international terrorism, the former officials – Dafna Rand, an ex-deputy assistant secretary of state, and Jeremy Konyndyk, the former director of the Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance – outlined how US officials helped the Saudis choose their targets in Yemen, created “no-strike” lists and sent trainers to reduce civilian harm.[Armed men inspect a Houthi-held detention center after it was hit by alleged Saudi-led airstrikes in Dhamar, Yemen, 1 September 2019.]Armed men inspect a Houthi-held detention center after it was hit by alleged Saudi-led airstrikes in Dhamar, Yemen, 1 September 2019. Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA“We came to the conclusion by late 2016 that although there were very many well-meaning and professional generals in the Saudi ministry of defense, there was a lack of political will at the top senior levels to reduce the number of civilian casualties,” Rand told the committee.Saudi and allied warplanes have conducted more than 20,000 airstrikes on Yemen since the war began, an average of 12 attacks a day, according to the Yemen Data Project. Only about a third of these attacks are on military targets. The coalition has also bombed hospitals, schools, markets, mosques, farms, factories, bridges, and power and water treatment plants.One of the most persistent false arguments advanced by Trump administration officials against efforts to end US involvement in Yemen is that the Saudis need American support and training to prevent even more civilians deaths. But the latest UN report belies that argument, showing the Saudis have not done any credible investigations into their attacks on civilians or taken enough measures to minimize casualties, even with US and British training.In fact, the UN findings reinforce revelations from a recent UK case brought by anti-war campaigners. A UK court of appeal ruled that British arms sales to Saudi Arabia were illegal. Documents presented during the case showed that, despite the British government’s claims, Saudi bombings of civilian targets took place within days after the UK provided training to the Saudi air force.Despite the mounting evidence of war crimes, Trump still firmly supports Mohammed bin Salman, the ruthless Saudi crown prince who is an architect of the Yemen war. Since April, Trump has used his veto power four times to prevent Congress from withdrawing US military support and ending weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and its allies. Congress could not muster enough votes to override Trump’s vetoes.The latest UN investigation, which found the US is likely complicit in war crimes, should give new momentum to the majority in Congress that wants to end American involvement in a disastrous conflict.-   Mohamad Bazzi, a journalism professor at New York University, is a former Middle East bureau chief at Newsday.

"Passage: Once, we were brothers.Once, almost seems like a whole life ago, I stood by him and we fought and we bled and we *killed* together.We were part of 5th Company, deployed to Ukraine during the escalation of the Crimean Conflict, a war which would later take more lives than Iraq and destroy more infrastructure than the Great War. We fought together in a conflict that, one day, only we would understand. And no politician could fathom what we saw there, no civilian could've known how we bled.We shared bullets, bottles, and blood - when we were brothers. We were stationed with Alpha Squad. We led all the missions, he and I. I was sergeant; he was corporal. All the men in that squad were our brothers, and we were theirs. I can still remember a time when I would've taken a bat to the head for any of those guys.Now, I stand before him, and we are no longer brothers.Somehow, the politics ate him. Probably ate me, too, he'd say. But now I'm sitting in an airport in Crimea and he has a gun to my head. And if anyone bothered to look up they wouldn't have thought for a moment that we were brothers.But we were. Once.Now he's a nationalist. Defected after the war, and found Russia to be his home, his country. I stayed with the US, and all he could say to me was how blind I'd become. After all we'd been through, as brothers, he couldn't believe I'd still take their side.But I didn't. I just want my pension. I just want to go home. So does Alpha Squad. They're sitting next to me, but their eyes are far away. I don't bother to call to them. This isn't their business.I look up at him. The barrel is staring down my face. He's smiling.""Once, we were brothers,"" he said.""Still are,"" I replied, ""Only we've seen what you've seen.""""No,"" he lowers the pistol, ""No, that's not it at all. You viewed what I did, but you didn't see. None of you did. Or you'd be on my side.""""I'm on no one's side. I just want to go home,"" my voice wavers, ""I'm tired. I miss my family.""""We're your family,"" he raises the pistol again, ""None of those fucks at home knows what happened here.""""Maybe it's better they don't know,"" I turn away, toward the rest of the squad. They're all busy in their own little worlds.The engineer specialist has a happy little grin on his face. He's remembering that time we saved those two kids after we accidentally killed their parents while we were clearing out an apartment complex. Those two kids later got blown up by a landmine. But he's not remembering that.Our sniper and spotter are talking, hushed, about what they'll do when they get home. I heard they might get married and move to South America. They want to forget what happened here. I know they never will.The new guy is sitting, chattering his teeth. He never got used to combat, because he deployed a week before our squad was relieved from duty - two weeks before the war ended. He still has the nighttime chills from killing. He's grasping a folder in his hand - for his psychologist, when he's back stateside.The airport is filled with people: refugees fleeing the war zone, servicemen and women going home, and children waiting for parents. No one notices us two.""They're right. You're just a soldier,"" he puts the pistol away, ""You don't get the bigger picture. But that's okay. Some of you aren't meant to. I'll see you boys stateside - in one piece or in a casket."" ""You're not gonna shoot me?"" I ask.""No, because we were brothers,"" he replied. He disappears into the crowd. I look down at my dog tags. No one will remember what we did here. The hippies will cuss us out; the families will avoid us; the government will ignore us.But we'll have each other. Because, once, we were brothers. And once is enough.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about violence?"

"The story ends with the narrator and his former brother in arms, who has become a nationalist, standing in an airport. The narrator is not sure if the man will shoot him, but he does not. The nationalist says that they were brothers once, and that is enough. Then the nationalist disappears into the crowd. The narrator looks down at his dog tags, and realizes that no one will remember what they did there.******Because they were once brothers, the corporal decides not to shoot the narrator. The soldier and his enemy who was once his brother shake hands and part ways. The soldier realizes he will never be remembered for joining the army. The story ends with their bond still in tact.******The narrator has a loaded gun placed to their head by their former brother. ******The narrator has a gun put to his head by his former comrade from the war. The narrator makes his counter offer by saying that they were brothers once. His comrade says he would never shoot him because they are brothers. His comrade goes over the reasons why they would not be brothers but, he leaves him at the airport. "
"Passage: [Columnist image]It is becoming increasingly more difficult to imagine a scenario that sees Los Angeles Kings defenceman Slava Voynov back in the NHL – ever. According to _Los Angeles Times_ reporter Nathan Fenno, who was in the courtroom today for Voynov’s preliminary hearing, it was alleged that the defenceman choked, kicked and punched his wife. Effectively, the allegation is that he laid a beating on her.Back on October 20, Voynov was suspended indefinitely with pay following his arrest on suspicion of domestic violence. At that time, the Police Department of the City of Redondo Beach issued this press release indicating that a female could be heard “screaming” and “crying” and that, later that night, Voynov accompanied the alleged victim to the hospital where he was arrested on suspicion that he inflicted the harm.DISTURBING EVIDENCE OF A BEATINGHere are some of the more disturbing allegations raised in Court today as reproduced from Fenno’s Twitter timeline:- Redondo Beach police officer: Voynov's wife had laceration over left eye, blood streaming, red marks on neck.- Officer says Voynov's wife said he struck her in the face with his fist.- Officer: Voynov pushed wife to ground multiple times, kicked her repeatedly while on ground, chocked her three times.- Officer: Voynov pushed her into flat-screen TV where she cut her face.- Officer: Voynov's wife required eight stitches to close wound above left eye.- Officer: ""There's bruising, red marks, scratches on the victim's neck.""- At Voynov's home, the officer noted blood all over bedroom, including covering comforter and a bloody handprint on floor.- Lead prosecutor Frank Dunnick: ""there's evidence to suggest prior domestic violence"" involving Voynov.Fenno added that while he could only “catch quick glimpses of photos of the injuries to Voynov's wife” and there was “lots of blood.”VOIDING OF CONTRACT, PRISON & DEPORTATION FOR VOYNOVVoynov is facing a number of legal issues. Firstly, he could be deported. In the United States, the crime of domestic violence can lead to serious immigration consequences for defendants who are not U.S. citizens. Under a federal U.S. law called the _Immigration and Nationality Act_, a non-citizen can be ordered deported if he is convicted of domestic violence.Voynov is also facing jail time. He was charged under Section 273.5 of the _California Penal Code_ for willfully inflicting corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a person. The charge can either be a felony or the less serious misdemeanor. The type of charge depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the injuries sustained and whether the defendant has a history of violence.In this case, Voynov was charged with a felony. As a result, he is facing up to four years in state jail with an additional five years if he inflicted great bodily injury. If he had been charged with a misdemeanor, he would have been facing up to one year in county jail.There is also a risk that Voynov’s contract could be voided (or terminated) by the NHL. The NHL CBA at Article 18-A.2 provides Commissioner Gary Bettman with very broad disciplinary powers when dealing with off-ice conduct that is “_DETRIMENTAL TO OR AGAINST THE WELFARE OF THE LEAGUE OR THE GAME OF HOCKEY_”. Among the punishments the Commissioner may impose is the termination of a player’s contract.The voiding of Voynov’s contract would most certainly be challenged by Donald Fehr and the NHLPA. However, terminating Voynov’s contract would not be unreasonable if the evidence is deemed reliable. Ray Rice changed everything. Indeed, the dramatically altered landscape surrounding domestic violence may force the hand of the league. And the CBA gives Bettman the power to take action (although the NHLPA would argue there are limits to that power).Only time will tell. For now, expect the NHL to do nothing and await the disposition of the criminal proceedings. Voynov will remain suspended indefinitely. Once the criminal proceedings wrap up, the NHL will make its decision. While things look exceedingly bleak for Voynov, they could get a lot worse should the photographs featuring his wife’s injuries leak to the public. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What are the downsides Voynov faces for beating his wife?"	"His contract may be voided and he may be deported. He also faces jail time.******He's currently suspended without pay indefinitely. Voynov is an immigrant, which means that he can be deported. His contract with NHL is at risk of termination, and he can face up to nine years in prison. Furthermore, should the photos of his wife's injuries leak to the public, he'd be under public backlash too.******Voynov faces both prison time and the risk of being deported due to the charge of domestic violence. He is also at risk of having his contract terminated by the NHL."
"Passage: They’re ComingMy name is David Johnson, Sargent Johnson, and I’ll never forget the day it all went down, the day it collided with Earth. We had a century to plan for this one asteroid, barely 100 km wide, but only the rich saved themselves, went off to their ships and left us all here to die. They promised the military refuge, but when the asteroid came sooner than expected, they just turned tails and ran. For the last 2 years, I’ve been searching for survivors along with my squadron and what we found isn’t what we expected nor is it pleasing. The outside world is a wasteland devoid of life… until now.While patrolling the perimeter we heard a small cry. When we found the source we were surprised by a small girl around 12 who looked confused and scared. We helped her up and took her to our base. Along the ride she started mumbling incomprehensible sounds and when we tried calming her she just blurted “They’re coming” and fell unconscious.Subsequently, we stabilized her and let sleep overcome her. Then my squad and I started talking, thinking who this girl was, how had she survived, and most importantly what she meant by “They’re coming”. Of course the latter gave us all the creeps, although nobody openly admitted it. That was, after all, what the military was all about; showing strength and hiding weakness no matter what the situation presented.When she finally woke up, we stared at her with expectant eyes and after an unbearable minute she got the cue and started explaining, to be honest, it’s not what any of us expected.“They’re coming, we have to run.” She said in a normal fashion.“Who the hell’s coming!” At that point, I’d lost my temper and started screaming at her.“The ones who did this to us and the only ones who escaped it,” she exclaimed as she pointed towards the wasteland that lay behind us. Her words stinging and leaving a bitter taste in the back of our mind.The same people who had promised to save us were the same people who set doom upon us. I was startled and couldn’t believe her words, didn’t want to believe her words. I mean, the scientist said an asteroid was coming, but a little push to it would explain why it came sooner, and according to this girl that little push was made by the rich folks. After a while of trying to explain to myself how it was possible since I couldn’t find any other explanation, she continued to talk:“There’s a way to stop them,”“Why would we?” I questioned, “We barely know you and now you’re asking us to stop an imaginary enemy who might or might not come here to destroy what’s left of us.”“If you don’t believe me look outside,” Just to prove her wrong, I walked through the door and took a peek outside. In the middle of the wasteland, I saw a single human figure just staring at us as if waiting for something. Then... all hell broke lose. As it came charging towards the encampment at an unnatural speed sirens started blaring to announce the base was on high alert. We grabbed our weapons and prepared for battle. Since we couldn't trust anyone, we started firing when it got within firing range. The bullets clashed against his skin, but it didn’t even flinch. “I told you so,” I heard from behind me. It was the girl again.“Would you shut the f-,” I retorted but, before I could finish she proceeded to use her arm as blades that went right through my upper torso, and with a vicious smile she pushed even farther until I could see the blood dripping off her fists.“They’re coming.” Those were the last words I heard before darkness embraced me.

"Passage: As he unfolded the brown wrappings of his tootsi-roll in the dinky little motel he had checked into the previous day, he noticed he had missed a spot from his earlier encounter.  A woman, around the age of 23, Susan was an only child, a repeated offender of the law, and quite possibly a prostitute, this we are unsure of.  Jerry, a Sophisticated young lad around the age of 25, he grew up a loner, the kids always made fun of him for never being interested in any girls when most others had hit puberty.  An outcast, Not a crazy psychopathic outcast like most other serial killers out there.  Simply one of those who could  easily be cast aside and forgotten about without a second guess.

Written upside down were the words ""i have to do this, I'm sorry.  I love you, beth"" with tear stains from her writing the note, and him reading it. Torn edges, and crumpled folds, he takes out his red pen, like he always does.

Most accept and they go out into a public place, they get to know each other.  After about an hour of conversation, he reveals he has a problem that can be fixed, their expressions are always the same, mouth open, shocked, confused, hurt, and misguided.  Unbeknownst to others around them, the two seem to be having a nice chat with some bad news, nothing to get over excited about.  Following her expressions comes the oh so  familiar apology, and tells them that he will give them a ride back. This is where things go from sweet to sour.He never sleeps with his victims, he has respect. perhaps not as much as the average Joe.  He doesn't torture them, Jerry makes their deaths quick and painless. sometimes strangulation, others, he will cut her throat.  he will always ask how they want to go. and he usually abides by it, as long as it doesn't involve a gun. He has a strong hatred towards guns, as a child, the kids would always pretend to shoot blanks at him.  one time, one of the guns had a real bullet. when it went off, it overpowered all the other powder caps that they were shooting, nothing slowed down. He could just feel the hot metallic texture of the bullet as it broke up inside his leg, he could feel the bullet get ripped apart. Everything he remembers went white after that, he may have blocked it out himself, or he may just not remember.He leaves his hotel room, not leaving any trace of anyone ever being there, it looked like the maids had just cleaned the room.

"Passage: PRIMOŽ (pronounced ['pɾimɔʒ]) is a high hill overgrown with trees[1], and is a part of a ridge separating the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It has many marked trails and a macadamized road leading to its peak. There is a historical trail intended for tourists with many information signs around its peak. It served an important military role during the Second World War, since it contained many tunnels and bunkers used by Italian army.[2]It is named after St. Primož and the Felicijan church, which was abandoned in the eighteenth century with practically no ruins leftover.[3]LocationPrimož is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. The town of Pivka is built on the northern and northeastern slopes of Primož.[4] It has a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin which contributed to its military importance during the Second World War.HistoryAfter the end of World War 1, Primož hill became Italian territory following an agreement between Italy, Great Britain, France and Russia alongside South Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia and various islands in the Adriatic sea. On November 12th, 1920, the border was drawn in accordance with the Treaty of Rapallo, crossing the Pivka basin, on the ridge of the Javorniki mountain chain. Primož's military tunnels were dug in 1930 as a part of the long Alpine Wall, a vast series of Italian Defense fortifications. The tunnels consisted of two lines; one directly on the border, and the second one a few kilometers behind it. Locals were kept away from the tunnels, and were only allowed to bring basic materials and food near its premises. The tunnels were constructed only by verified members of the Italian National Fascist Party.[5] The tunnels were secured with steel plates coated with a thick layer of concrete. The tunnels are long in total,[6] but they were never used for military purposes.[7] After the withdrawal of Italian forces, local people took valuables from the area, and in 1944, German forces destroyed the tunnels in fear that allied Partisans would find military use for them.[8]There are a number of tourist trails leading to the peak.

"Passage: -   English-   News LIVING FILM HERITAGE. A total donation of 30 million kroner from three foundations is making it possible to digitise, study and disseminate more than 400 silent films from the golden age of Danish cinema.11. December 2018One of the most important chapters in Danish film history will now become available thanks to a donation of DKK 30 million from the A.P. Møller Foundation, the Aage and Johanne Louis-Hansen Foundation and the Augustinus Foundation.From around 1910, the Danish film industry was a world leader, both commercially and artistically, with Nordisk Films Kompagni (now Nordisk Film) at the forefront. Stars like Asta Nielsen, Valdemar Psilander and Fy & Bi were famous way beyond their home country, and Denmark’s greatest film director, Carl Th. Dreyer, was prolific during this period as well. When sound films gained ground in the early 1930s, production companies scrapped their inventories of silent films. Only an estimated 20% of the Danish silent film production exists today.The archives contain at least 50 titles that have not been shown since they were first released more than a century ago. Among them, we might find forgotten masterpieces that could change our understanding of Danish silent film history.In the coming years, the Danish Film Institute will digitise, study and disseminate Denmark’s entire silent film heritage, consisting of some 415 titles with a combined running time of around 350 hours. The films range wide and far, from prestige productions with international appeal to run-of-the-mill farces and test films, illustrating the technical evolution from silent to sound, colour to black and white, and so on. []The biggest stars die young. The world famous silent film actor Valdemar Psilander died only 32 years old.Studying and disseminating the film heritage The project is the biggest film-dissemination effort ever in Denmark and follows four years of work mapping the collections. The many films and supplementary materials will now be made freely available to curious viewers and institutions of learning around the world, where Danish silents are already part of the curriculum for students of film history.The masterpieces in the collections are being restored and scanned for theatrical screening, and an online universe is being created featuring all the films, accompanied by dissemination and research articles. Along the way, the Film Institute will share knowledge about the restoration and digitisation efforts. []Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad were both a married couple and colleagues who worked in Germany.A three-year Danish-German research project affiliated with the digitisation effort will map the cross-border traffic of ideas and people between two leading nations of the silent film era, Denmark and Germany. The project is carried out in partnership with the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cologne. The research team comprises five senior researchers, a Ph.D. fellow and a research assistant.Jakob Buhl Vestergaard, Deputy Managing Director of the Danish Film Institute, saysCONTACTLARS-MARTIN SØRENSENForskningslederTlf. +45 3374 3574larss@dfi.dkJAKOB BUHL VESTERGAARDVicedirektørTlf. +45 2020 1838jakobv@dfi.dk""It is with great gratitude to the contributing foundations, and tremendous anticipation, that we are launching this comprehensive project. The archives contain at least 50 titles that have not been shown since they were first released more than a century ago. Among them, we might find forgotten masterpieces that could change our understanding of Danish silent film history. In any event, we have now been given a unique opportunity to learn about our shared past, as told in motion pictures. This is what film can do.""FACTSIn the coming years, the Danish Film Institute will digitise, study and disseminate the entire Danish silent film heritage: 415 titles, with a total running time of around 350 hours. Apart from the films themselves, documentation materials, such as film programmes, stills and posters, will be digitised and made available, including in an online universe and at a silent film festival organised by the Cinematheque.The project is made possible by a donation of DKK 30 million from the A.P. Møller Foundation, the Aage and Johanne Louis-Hansen Foundation and the Augustinus Foundation. _Physical and digital dissemination of the film heritage_The Danish Film Institute aims to bring the film heritage to life for everyone. This is done through events at Copenhagen’s Cinematheque and in partnerships with cinemas nationwide. It is also done digitally via the streaming site ""Danmark på film"" (Denmark on Film), featuring documentaries from the 1899-1995 period.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What are the major reasons why some of the old, silent Danish films are being digitalized and made available for free?"	"The Danish Film Institute aims to bring the film heritage to life for everyone. The many films and supplementary materials will now be made freely available to curious viewers and institutions of learning around the world.******The curatorial process of selecting which films are put on the public site and which are restored is meticulous and considered by directors who are experts in the field. The initial purpose of digitizing all the Danish films is to make them available to the general public and to allow further study of important aspects of film history. "
"Passage: TONI LANDER née PIHL PETERSEN (1931–1985) was a Danish ballerina who specialized in the ballets of August Bournonville. After becoming a solo dancer with the Royal Danish Ballet in 1950, she was a guest dancer with the Original Ballet Russe in 1951. She was then engaged by the Paris Opera Ballet until 1954. Lander also appeared with the London Festival Ballet in the late 1950s and with the American Ballet Theatre in the 1960s. After a few years back in Denmark in the early 1970s, in 1976 she joined the Ballet West in Salt Lake City. After a short illness, she died there of cancer in May 1985.[1][2][3]Early lifeBorn in Gentofte on 19 June 1931, Toni Pihl Petersen was the daughter of Knud Åge Carl Pihl Petersen (1905–1972) and Agnes Margrethe Andersen (1907–1950).[4] When she was six, she began training under Leif Ørnberg (1904–1977), who immediately recognized her talents. In 1939, as an eight-year-old, she was admitted to the Royal Danish Ballet School where she advanced quickly. Thanks to her height, she was able to join the ballet corps while still studying. The ballet sequences of Bournonville were the basis for the ballet school but as she became an aspirant, Harald Lander took a personal interest in her training, introducing her to Russian ballet.[5]CareerWhen she was 15, she make her début as Sophie in Vilhelm Christian Holm's _Livjægerne paa Amager_ (The Lifeguards on Amager). A year later, she gained wide acclaim, dancing Margot Lander's difficult part in _Étude_. In 1951 Lander rewrote the part for her. Ten years later, under the name _Études_, it became her most notable part for the rest of her career.[6]In 1950, she became a solo dancer. On 15 April of that year, she married Harald Lander (1905–1971) but her relationship with him was to bring her major problems. In 1951, he was dismissed from the Royal Danish Ballet for misusing his position. She followed him to Paris where he became artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet but in order to avoid accusations of favoratism, she continued to train in Russian ballet under Ljubov Egorova, and Olga Preobrajenska. For a few months, she danced with the Ballets Russes but moved to London in 1954 where she appeared as a replacement at the London Festival Ballet, taking on the role of Odette in Swan Lake at short notice. She performed so well that she was engaged by the company for the next five years.[7]She travelled widely with the Festival Ballet, performing both Russian ballet and Bournonville roles. In 1957, she appeared at the Tivoli Concert Hall in Copenhagen where she danced in _Études_ and _Swan Lake_. She was honoured with the Order of the Dannebrog. She returned to the Falconer Centre in Copenhagen in 1959, where both she and her husband were widely acclaimed, preparing the way for _Etudes_ at the Royal Danish Theatre.[8]In 1960, she moved to New York for an engagement with American Ballet Theatre. She appeared in a more extensive repertoire, including _Miss Julie_ and _The Moon Reindeer_ by the Swedish choreographer Birgit Culberg, as well as Antony Tudor's _Jardin aux Lilas_. When Flemming Flindt became artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet in 1966, he invited Toni Lander to appear as a guest dancer in 1967. She demonstrated her wide experience by dancing the pas de deux from _Don Quixote_, Eliza in Bournonville's _Konservatoriet_ and the title role from _Miss Julie_, all in one evening.[9]In 1964, After she and Harald Lander had divorced in 1964, in January 1966 she married the American dancer Bruce Marks with whom she had three children: Eric Anthony (1968), Adam Christopher (1970), Kenneth Rikard (1974). Her last assignment with the American Ballet was in the première of José Limón's _The Moor's Pavane_.[10] In 1971, she returned to Denmark after an international career lasting 20 years, quite exceptional for a Danish ballerina. In parallel with appearances in _The Moor's Pavane_ (1971–1976), she taught at the ballet school while Marks performed as a solo dancer. When Marks was invited to become artistic director of Ballet West in Salt Lake City, Lander once again followed her husband, becoming head of training there. While with the Ballet West, she presented _Études_ at the Paris Opera, Budapest Opera and the National Ballet of Amsterdam.[11] She collaborated with Flemming Ryberg on presenting a new version of Bournonville's _Abdallah_ which premièred in February 1985. In 1983, she had divorced Marks and was ready to accept an invitation to become the first female artistic director for the Royal Danish Ballet. She was prevented from doing so from a rapidly developing cancer which led to her death in Salt Lake City on 19 May 1985, aged only 53.[12][13][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about Toni Lander's private life?"

"Passage: _Battlefield V_’s decision to prominently feature women in combat as part of its World War II setting may have angered some gamers online — who responded to the inclusion of female soldiers with the #NotMyBattlefield hashtag — but developers at Electronic Arts and DICE remain unmoved by the reaction.In an interview with __ _Gamasutra_, EA chief creative officer Patrick Söderlund says that the developer is uninterested in taking flak for diversifying the gaming space. “We stand up for the cause, because I think those people who don’t understand it, well, you have two choices: either accept it or don’t buy the game,” he says. “I’m fine with either or.” According to Söderlund, the dev team itself also pushed for women in _Battlefield V._In an interview with _The Verge_ this week, lead designer Lars Gustavsson says that he was surprised by the negative reaction to the inclusion of women, particularly because he had heard so many fans ask for it. “If I got a dollar for every interview I’ve been in through the years, where people challenged us about not having female soldiers, I would be a rich man,” he says. “So to finally be involved with this decision, it’s actually quite mindblowing.”Many of those who used the #NotMyBattlefield hashtag complained that the inclusion of women was “historically inaccurate,” despite women playing a variety of roles during WWII as everything from fighter pilots to snipers. Söderlund found the response to be both ignorant and beside the point. ”These are people who are uneducated — they don’t understand that this is a plausible scenario, and listen: this is a game,” he says.Executive producer Aleksander Grøndal also pushed back against the hashtag, saying the developer “will always put fun over authentic.” Nor is this a new development for the series. As general manager Oskar Gabrielson explained on Twitter, “the _Battlefield_ sandbox has always been about playing the way you want.” This sometimes means offering fantastical experiences that are neither realistic nor historically accurate, “like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With _BFV_ you also get the chance to play as who you want. This is #everyonesbattlefield.”EA’s dogged response to this debacle marks another instance of creators standing up against toxic fan bases who seek to rail against diversity and what they view as “PC politics.” When creators speak out against bad actors — whether they’re addressing Comicsgate, _Rick and Morty_, or harassment from _Star Wars_ fans — they’re sending a powerful message about how abusive and exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.Gaming today is more gender-diverse than it’s ever been, Söderlund says, and there are “a lot of female people who want to play, and male players who want to play as a badass [woman].” In trying to explain the so-called controversy to his own 13-year-old daughter, Söderlund says he came to realize how ridiculous the conceit of the online backlash was. “I’m like, okay, as a parent, how the hell am I gonna respond to this? And I just said, ‘You know what? You’re right,’” says Söderlund. “‘This is not okay.’”_CORRECTION: A quote from Lars Gustavsson was originally attributed to Oskar Gabrielson. We have corrected our story and regret the error._ Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about gamers?"	"The article says that gamers have reacted negatively to the inclusion of women in _Battlefield V_ because of the #NotMyBattlefield hashtag. ******The article states that some gamers have responded negatively to the inclusion of women in Battlefield V as combat soldiers. However, according to the developer team, an overwhelming number of fans have asked for female soldiers to be included in the game.

"Passage: Champagne, chardonnay and second-rate vodka. The descent into Vanity Heights was a perfect contradiction. Darcy’s den was full of promises. The promises of allure, freedom, revelry. The promises of power and powder, regret, addiction. But the promise that Vanity Heights fulfilled best was not Darcy’s own. It was the promise flashed upon the television, upon the computer screen, canonised on the glossed pages of magazines. The expectations of how teenager life should be; the expectations, up until this night, crushed by education and responsibility. This was the promise that led Darcy’s guests down the stairs. Down the stairs into Vanity Heights. The house had transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room, when she arrived. “Celeste!” he exclaimed, prancing over to her, a stick of addiction in one hand and a glass of hobby in the other. She gave a long hug, a short conversation and an expected question. With a customary smile, Darcy gave to her an expected bottle of answer. The party raved on, yet the revelry was muted by the brick wall that barricaded Celeste from the action. The rhythmic dripping of the basin tap was the only music Celeste had, yet she chose to reapply her face instead of dancing. She wanted to dance, though, and she knew Darcy would be waiting for her, so she rushed through her routine. She clasped onto her 50mL glass friend, already thrice-used, even though she had been in the bathroom only five minutes.         The drink was downed within seconds of being poured; the liquid sunk to her stomach. She could feel the warm tendrils, cooing words of friendship, branching through her chest, her stomach and finally, finally, back up to drown her mind; pulling her further from the world and closer to her weekend friends.         Six doses later, to finish the bottle, and she was ready to join them. No one ever really knew why she was there. Good school, great grades, aspirations of business and law. Nevertheless, she was soon jiving and twisting and dropping on the floor, with Darcy and other men: around them and in their laps; their hands hoping to get in hers.  Her beholder lay seemingly dormant in her stomach; though its dark tendrils were tightening, strengthening their grip on Celeste, controlling her like a puppet with tangled strings. She thought the overseer a friend, a protector, but her body knew better.Celeste mapped her escape as soon as she felt it. Up the stairs, out of Vanity Heights, past the kitchen, into the garden bed just by the backdoor. She pushed through the crowd. Darcy saw her leave; he knew why, but he didn’t follow.  He never did. By the time she reached the stairs, the beast had revealed itself. A kraken, furious as red, limbs thrashing about inside of her, fighting desperately for an escape. Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. ‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.Whilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  ‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. The stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. ‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. ‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about what happened to Celeste after she passed out?"

Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. ‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.Whilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  ‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. The stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. ‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. ‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about Celeste?"	"Celeste is a teenager who attends a good school and has aspirations of business and law.

"Passage: []Warriors returned from the Scattering - Heretics of Dune french edition cover artTHE SCATTERING was a major historical event that occurred in the chaotic period following the death of Leto Atreides II, the God-Emperor. Leto's death saw the eventual breakdown of his empire, severe famine on many worlds, and the introduction of Ixian no-ships. It was all part of The Golden Path, as put forward by Leto, which was triggered by a perceived need to diversify the human race and allow it to evolve.Contents-   1 Origin-   2 Scattering Space-   3 Return from the Scattering-   4 Behind the Scenes-   5 AppearancesOrigin[edit | edit source]Leto II's prescience allowed him to see into both the past and the future, and he believed that ten thousand years of rule by the Faufreluches had allowed the human race to become stagnant, and that drastic action on Leto's part was needed in order for the human race to survive.Leto II was also aware that a likelihood existed that the Thinking Machines, before they were destroyed in the Butlerian Jihad, had scattered. A stagnant human race would have little chance should the machines return. The entire purpose of ""Leto's Golden path"" was to force the human race to abandon certainty, security, and safety as individual goals and to ""scatter"" not only geographically, but also to do so technologically, ideologically, and socio-politically.As a result of this philosophy, during the reign of Leto II humanity was predominantly planet bound and ruled by an iron fist for more than 3500 years. This was in contrast to the relative freedom of expression and movement people enjoyed to a limited degree under the Faufreluches, the limits being predominantly the inherent control of feudal rule and the Spacing Guild monopoly on space travel. Indeed, Leto II exerted a level of control that was unprecedented in the Imperium, including power over the Guild and space travel, a feat that previous Emperors had been unable to accomplish. Upon Leto's death, the stalwart and long-established order of the Imperium disintegrated, as did control over freedoms and movement, and as a result, humanity rediscovered independence and nobilities on an unprecedented scale. This paved the way for humanity to ""scatter"" across the universe into the unknown and further evolution of the human race.According to Leto II's plan, his death was followed by a collapse of political control and Spice supplies - as it would take generations for the Spice cycle to reassert itself on Rakis. Political order collapsed and entire worlds starved to death, in a chaotic period known as the Famine Times. The Scattering was an immediate response to the Famine Times, as refugees fled the anarchy consuming the Old Imperium.Scattering Space[edit | edit source]During The Scattering, many people remained within the boundaries of the Old Imperium. Many, however, did not. Countless humans departed the Old Imperium for uncharted space, never to return. For 1,500 years, humanity explored the uncharted realms of the universe beyond the boundaries of the Old Imperium. New groups and cultures evolved.During the Scattering, vast waves of refugees spread outwards into uncharted space, so that the number of human-colonized worlds exponentially ballooned both in number and spread. The Bene Gesserit who remained in the territories of the Old Imperium could only make vague guesses at the size of ""Scattering space"", as it was theoretically infinite and even the Honored Matres might not know its full extent. One clue is that the Lost Ones returning from the Scattering refer to the Old Imperium as ""the million worlds"" or ""the million planets"" - implying that Scattering space is at least several multiples larger than that.Little is also known of the exact socio-political history of what happened in Scattering space, other than that its development across 1,500 years was fairly rapid - a direct reaction to the enforced sedentary nature of Leto's Pace for 3,500 years, or the 10,000 year static structure of the Faufreluches under the Corrino empire.What is known is that eventually, the Honored Matres developed as a fusion of Bene Gesserit and Fish Speakers (and possibly other groups) who had fled into the Scattering. An aggressive group focused on conquest and domination, the Honored Matres carved out vast swaths of territory among the worlds settled in the Scattering. One of these worlds, or perhaps a collection of worlds, was referred to as ""Dur"".Another group that rose to prominence in Scattering space were the Lost Tleilaxu - no longer bound by even the pretense of following the restrictions of the Great Convention, they pushed genetic manipulation drastically farther than their Bene Tleilax forbearers in the Old Imperium ever did. Among other creations, the Lost Tleilaxu brazenly spliced together human and animal stock, creating the feline-based Futars and fish-based Phibians. The Honored Matres came into conflict with the Lost Tleilaxu, becoming their bitter enemies, in wars that spread across much of Scattering space. During this time the Tleilaxu refined the Futars, creating them for the express purpose of hunting Honored Matres. Nonetheless, the Matres managed to capture and enslaves many Futars and Phibians.Return from the Scattering[edit | edit source]About 1,500 years after the death of God-Emperor Leto II, many of the Lost Ones began to return from the Scattering to the space of the Old Imperium. Chief among these were the Honored Matres, who carved a path of conquest whether they went, and exterminated the Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit wherever they found them.The Bene Gesserit eventually learned that the cause of this return was that the Honored Matres were fleeing an even more powerful adversary they encountered out in the Scattering, which the Honored Matres only briefly alluded to as ""The Enemy"" or ""the Enemies of Many Faces"". The Matres had managed to steal some of the powerful Obliterator weapons from this Enemy before being easily overwhelmed. While the Honored Matres were fixated on destroying the Bene Gesserit, they were also determined to learn their methods of cellular control over their own metabolism which granted them immunity to disease and poisons - a skill that had atrophied among the Matres themselves when they split off from the Bene Gesserit. From this the Bene Gesserit also deduced that the Enemy the Matres were fleeing had made extensive use of biological warfare, against which the Matres no longer had adequate defenses.Behind the Scenes[edit | edit source]Within the context of Frank Herbert's original novels, the Scattering occurs between the novels God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune.Appearances[edit | edit source]-   _God Emperor of Dune_ (First mentioned)-   _Heretics of Dune_ (Mentioned only)-   _Chapterhouse: Dune_ (Mentioned only) Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about the people who left the boundaries of the Old Imperium?"

"Passage: Perched on a steel beast of war, I pondered my own existence. A sergeant in the army, with a caring family and spouse, medals to my name and a desire to live. But how far did it go? How far can I run before I fall, and there is nobody there to pick me up? I wanted my memories to last forever. Lively, energetic, spirited: The men I commanded were my bread and butter. Valiantly serving under my order for 3 years prior to Operation Neptune, we held our lives in our rifles. I sat with them on our steel beast, waiting to be unloaded with the other men. How long did we have?Huddled into a vehicle reminiscent to the Kraken himself, I became lost in thought. This strange plan, these peculiar men. Curled up amongst each other, ignorance of bliss, we stood shoulder by shoulder like lambs to the slaughter.Dainty fingers dawdled on the triggers. Who was he? Who was he to take a life? Only the grateful had the heart to pull, and fire.Eyes plunged backwards, body lurched forward. Crumpled to their knees. Fell to the trenches, writhing in the dirt, men howled in fits of pain.Let the deceased roam the realms they no longer wanted to exist.Waves trickled onto our clothes, soaking us from the inside out. The storm rose above our mortal toil; Mother Nature has no patience. Salty sea air tempted our nostrils of home and valour, but it did little to front the horrors on the beach. Gunfire ablaze, our Kraken approached the beachhead. This is true war. Fear, anger, pride, camaraderie, pain: a will to survive. Lead continued to find its way towards my men, but I convinced myself they could never hit me. Hot, piercing metal seared its way through the earth, which may as well have stood still, striking our position with brute inaccuracy. Inside the sudden silence, my superior barked those damn dreaded words.I was told there was artillery inbound. No reinforcements. 30 seconds was all we had.Mortar seemingly erupted from the crust, taking my men with it into the air. 3 of my men were taken in the first blast. They had aimed that one for my squad. These weren’t the first men to die with me, and certainly won’t be the last. More explosives inbound, and no clear way to escape. It didn’t look hopeless, just fatal. Another 2 fell down, injured, which is another pair of notches on my watch. The squad was starting to break down into fragments, and no longer sure who made it out, we tried to hide, run and fight.Us, a ragtag group of soldiers, versus an entire German platoon. It was at this point we had all agreed to never be captured alive. We held our position over the lagoon, keeping our ground with joyful valence in the darkest hour. I took a step backwards, and promptly fell into the water. My men must have assumed I’d been hit, I didn’t see them again.It seemed like I was floating gracefully for an eternity, and in my frenzy, I reasoned that I was hated by those I loved, and regrets filled my soul. It wasn’t death that did this; it waswar. I also reasoned that these would be my final emotions, my final tribute, to this earth, and I should cherish them. How would I know when I died? It faded to black long before I fell to my watery grave.In my absence of consciousness, I was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline, picking up survivors and POW’s alike. It appeared I was alive, and the luckiest one in the squad, according to those Brits. They would never be able to comprehend what I saw, and what I lost.“It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those whoare willing to endure pain with patience.”- Julius Caesar(Any and all constructive criticism greatly recommended) Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about which World War the narrator was in?"	"It is implied it is WW2 as Operation Neptune is mentioned."
"Passage: Heyoo everyone. This is a story I wrote for my intro to creative writing class. I'm thinking about double majoring of maybe minoring in the subject. If you could let me know what you think of the story that'd be very nice of you. Thanks.p.s.--brutal honesty is encouragedBaby RayRaymond was my little brother. We called him Baby Ray until he was old enough to tell us to shut up, and after that we just called him Ray. The same year Ray was born my parents got us a dog. A huge Bernese mountain dog named Theodore. Theodore was the coolest dog ever. He grew to mammoth proportions, but when he was a puppy people used to think he was a stuffed animal. Without a doubt, that dog was the motherfuckin’ bee’s-knees. He was the smartest dog I ever met. I know everyone thinks that their dog is the best, but Theodore really was. Ray used to ride atop him like he was a horse, pulling his ears like they were reigns and screaming with laughter. I swear he understood English perfectly. We would ask him, “Where’s Mom?” and he’d lead us right to her. It even seemed like he understood the jokes we made, howling along with my brother and I as we laughed at whatever stupid joke the other had made. Walking Theodore was considered to be a “chore”, but my brother and I both enjoyed the activity. We’d switch off days of the week for who got to walk him. It was my favorite part of the day. Just me and Theodore, walking down the street. Straight chillin’. When Ray and I got older we would roll up little joints and walk Theodore to the woods. Once we were there, we’d smoke and take him off the leash. While we lazily strolled around the woods, Theodore would run ahead. He never went far though, always waiting for us and staying within eyesight. Whenever we got a bit too baked and got lost, he always could smell his way back to the car. That dog was awesome, and we loved him like he was a long, lost third brother. I was 16 the day that Theodore died. I was playing my favorite video game, Crash Bandicoot, on PlayStation, when I heard a scream coming from the front yard. My mom was out there gardening, and I knew there was nothing in the yard that could make her scream like that. I jumped off the couch and ran outside. Theodore was lying dead in the middle of the street. Apparently a car had whipped around the corner too fast and had hit him right in front of our house. He died right away. I was kneeling in the road next to his body before I realized that my mom was doing the same thing. Except she was kneeling next to my little brother, a pool of blood gathering around his head, Theodore’s leash still gripped in his hand. The way I felt about Theodore was pretty similar to the way I felt about Ray. Just the way Theodore was the best dog in the world, Ray was the best little brother in the world. He was a hilarious little kid, and was oddly wise for his young age. Even though I was two years older than him, I often found myself going to him for advice. He was one of my best friends. That all changed after the accident. Ray had suffered brain damage and entered what the doctors called a “vegetative state”. This turned out to be permanent. Years went by. Ray made no improvements. He was a vegetable, in a coma. He responded to nothing. No blinking, no head movement—nothing at all. I couldn’t stand to see my little brother like that. The kid who had once schooled me at Super Smash Bro’s, who I had taught to shoot a basketball, was now breathing only with the help of machines. He would never walk again, or laugh, or do any of the cool shit we had always said we would. One day, about 3 years after the accident, the doctors came in the room to discuss something with my mom. This was weird, and signified to us that something important was afoot. My brother had a whole slew of doctors that attended to him, but never had they all been together in the room at the same time. My mother and I were sitting next to my brother’s bed when they walked in, reading the newspaper to him. My mom believed that he could hear what was going on around him, and that he especially enjoyed the paper. When he woke up, she reasoned, he would want to be up on current events. “Excuse us,” the most senior looking doctor said. “Could we have a moment?” The doctors asked me to leave the room so they could speak to my mother, and obviously, I refused. If there was something they had to say about Ray, then they could damn well say it in front of me. My mom agreed. “He can stay,” she told them, although they clearly weren’t happy about it, judging from the looks they shot each other. They kept it short and sweet. “Ray’s been with us for three years now, and he hasn’t shown any sign of improvement. He is in a permanent vegetative state, and will be that way for the rest of his life. You may want to consider taking him off life support.” My mom took this a lot better than I thought she would. It was because she fully held onto hope that my brother would one day wake up totally fine, as if he were simply waking up from a really long nap. Every morning she started her day thinking, knowing, that that would be the day my brother was sitting up in his bed waiting for her when she walked into his room. Every morning, my mom woke up at 6am and got ready for the day, which consisted of sitting at the hospital. Every single day, she sat in that uncomfortable plastic chair next to Ray’s bed. Reading, talking, and praying for her empty shell of a son. Her life had turned into a constant observance of my brother’s horrible state. She was trapped in her refusal to accept the truth—that her baby Ray was gone. I had come to terms with the fact that my brother was basically dead, and I knew he would have accepted and agreed with that fact. I knew he would have hated what his “life” had become, and would not want to exist in such a way. I was able to move on with my life because of this. My mom couldn’t.That’s why I decided to pull the plug. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story have to say about Theodore?"	"Theodore was a dog that the narrator and his brother had. They loved him like a brother. He was the smartest dog they had ever met. The protagonist felt the same way about the dog as he did about his brother: they were both the best in the world.

Without a doubt, that dog was the motherfuckin’ bee’s-knees. He was the smartest dog I ever met. I know everyone thinks that their dog is the best, but Theodore really was. Ray used to ride atop him like he was a horse, pulling his ears like they were reigns and screaming with laughter. I swear he understood English perfectly. We would ask him, “Where’s Mom?” and he’d lead us right to her. It even seemed like he understood the jokes we made, howling along with my brother and I as we laughed at whatever stupid joke the other had made. Walking Theodore was considered to be a “chore”, but my brother and I both enjoyed the activity. We’d switch off days of the week for who got to walk him. It was my favorite part of the day. Just me and Theodore, walking down the street. Straight chillin’. When Ray and I got older we would roll up little joints and walk Theodore to the woods. Once we were there, we’d smoke and take him off the leash. While we lazily strolled around the woods, Theodore would run ahead. He never went far though, always waiting for us and staying within eyesight. Whenever we got a bit too baked and got lost, he always could smell his way back to the car. That dog was awesome, and we loved him like he was a long, lost third brother. I was 16 the day that Theodore died. I was playing my favorite video game, Crash Bandicoot, on PlayStation, when I heard a scream coming from the front yard. My mom was out there gardening, and I knew there was nothing in the yard that could make her scream like that. I jumped off the couch and ran outside. Theodore was lying dead in the middle of the street. Apparently a car had whipped around the corner too fast and had hit him right in front of our house. He died right away. I was kneeling in the road next to his body before I realized that my mom was doing the same thing. Except she was kneeling next to my little brother, a pool of blood gathering around his head, Theodore’s leash still gripped in his hand. The way I felt about Theodore was pretty similar to the way I felt about Ray. Just the way Theodore was the best dog in the world, Ray was the best little brother in the world. He was a hilarious little kid, and was oddly wise for his young age. Even though I was two years older than him, I often found myself going to him for advice. He was one of my best friends. That all changed after the accident. Ray had suffered brain damage and entered what the doctors called a “vegetative state”. This turned out to be permanent. Years went by. Ray made no improvements. He was a vegetable, in a coma. He responded to nothing. No blinking, no head movement—nothing at all. I couldn’t stand to see my little brother like that. The kid who had once schooled me at Super Smash Bro’s, who I had taught to shoot a basketball, was now breathing only with the help of machines. He would never walk again, or laugh, or do any of the cool shit we had always said we would. One day, about 3 years after the accident, the doctors came in the room to discuss something with my mom. This was weird, and signified to us that something important was afoot. My brother had a whole slew of doctors that attended to him, but never had they all been together in the room at the same time. My mother and I were sitting next to my brother’s bed when they walked in, reading the newspaper to him. My mom believed that he could hear what was going on around him, and that he especially enjoyed the paper. When he woke up, she reasoned, he would want to be up on current events. “Excuse us,” the most senior looking doctor said. “Could we have a moment?” The doctors asked me to leave the room so they could speak to my mother, and obviously, I refused. If there was something they had to say about Ray, then they could damn well say it in front of me. My mom agreed. “He can stay,” she told them, although they clearly weren’t happy about it, judging from the looks they shot each other. They kept it short and sweet. “Ray’s been with us for three years now, and he hasn’t shown any sign of improvement. He is in a permanent vegetative state, and will be that way for the rest of his life. You may want to consider taking him off life support.” My mom took this a lot better than I thought she would. It was because she fully held onto hope that my brother would one day wake up totally fine, as if he were simply waking up from a really long nap. Every morning she started her day thinking, knowing, that that would be the day my brother was sitting up in his bed waiting for her when she walked into his room. Every morning, my mom woke up at 6am and got ready for the day, which consisted of sitting at the hospital. Every single day, she sat in that uncomfortable plastic chair next to Ray’s bed. Reading, talking, and praying for her empty shell of a son. Her life had turned into a constant observance of my brother’s horrible state. She was trapped in her refusal to accept the truth—that her baby Ray was gone. I had come to terms with the fact that my brother was basically dead, and I knew he would have accepted and agreed with that fact. I knew he would have hated what his “life” had become, and would not want to exist in such a way. I was able to move on with my life because of this. My mom couldn’t.That’s why I decided to pull the plug. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the story's main event."

"Passage: “REUBEN BRIGHT” is a (modified) Petrarchan sonnet[1] written by American poet Edwin Arlington Robinson, early in his career, and published in _Children of the Night_ (1897). The poem acquired some fame as teaching material for English teachers.Form and summary“Reuben Bright” is a sonnet with decasyllabic lines of iambic pentameter.[2] Its structure is that of the Petrarchan sonnet according to Stephen Regan;[3] its rhyme scheme is abba abba cdcd ee. In other words, the octet has two quatrains of enclosed rhyme, and the sestet has a quatrain of alternating rhyme and a concluding couplet.The poem tells of a butcher, Reuben Bright, who might be supposed to be rough and unfeeling because of his profession, but when news is brought that his wife is to die, he cries like a baby. When she dies, he packs up all the articles she handcrafted in a chest and adds cedar boughs (a “traditional symbol of death”[4]) and then destroys the slaughter house. One critic said the poem shows “a man's devotion to his wife”.[5] Like many of Robinson's narrative sonnets, “Reuben Bright” has a “characteristic signature: usually a bizarre or extraordinary story”, according to Donald Hall, who also noted that in its first printing the last line was altered significantly by a typo: the poem had been printed with the last line saying “tore down _to_ the slaughter house”.[6]Critical appreciationRobinson wrote “Reuben Bright” around the same time as “Richard Cory”. David Perkins, in his _A History of Modern Poetry_ (first published 1976), called some of those early poems including “Reuben Bright” and “Richard Cory” “revolutionary”, with narrative elements of prose fiction brought into a lyric poetry written about realistic subject matter in vernacular language.[7] Stephen Regan likewise notes the “plain-speaking, intimately conversational idiom”. The poem's value, he argues, lies in the tension between that “matter-of-fact” language (and the close tonal connection between, for instance, “Bright” and “brute”) and the psychological depths Robinson hints at, opened by the butcher's “capacity for deep feeling”.[8] Robinson critic Warner Berthoff had said that “Robinson is the poet of casualties; of broken lives and exhausted consciences”, and Regan saw Reuben Bright as the best example of this quality.[9]Unlike a regular sonnet of this form whose dramatic turn can be expected to come between the octet and the sestet, “Reuben Bright” has no such dramatic change in “mood or attitude”, just a narrative development. An ironic twist does not come until the last line, which, as Milton R. Stern noted, is a device frequently found in Robinson's poetry.[10] Poet and critic Donald Hall also commented on the structure, and did note a kind of conclusion at the end of the octave: “Robinson's octave ends with wild grief; but the active imagination of the sestet is his genius--the cow-killer converted”.[11]Use in teaching literatureMilton Stern, writing in 1957 considered the sonnet to be an excellent poem to teach poetry to students who might have gotten jaded with traditional sonnets, and are challenged to try and figure out how the shocking ending results from the death of Bright's wife. That the poem does all this with rather ordinary language and without traditional poetic elements is important as well: “the student can more easily see that poetry does speak to our own human condition”. According to Stern, “Robinson constantly takes 'little' people, 'ordinary' people, who lead the 'usual' life of all of us, and finds therein the dramatic, the poetic, and the human”.[12] In an article published two years after, Stern again suggested “Reuben Bright”, along with a few other Robinson poems, as very useful “Poems for Teaching”.[13]Martha Fisher, in a discussion of the process-intervention model in teaching literature, mentioned “Reuben Bright” (and “Richard Cory”) as a narrative poem that students could be asked to rewrite as a short story or a play.[14][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the structure of this poem."

Milton Stern points out that Robinson takes ordinary people, leading ordinary lives and ""finds therein the dramatic, the poetic and the human.""******The poem may be useful for teaching students who might have gotten jaded by traditional sonets. The poem is used to help the students see that poetry does indeed speak to the human condition. The use of common words and not traditional poetic elements helps the student grasp the concept better. Another interesting point is that the poem's ending points to how a butcher has a capacity for deep feeling."

She won an Alfred Alexander Scholarship and received the Karaviotis Scholarship. After graduating she went on to successfully compete in numerous competitions.

The text says that Katie Bray is a mezzo-soprano noted for her baroque repertoire and that she studied at the Royal Academy of Music where she was taught by Elizabeth Ritchie and Iain Ledingham.

"Passage: LAZARUS NKALA (26 February 1927 – 3 December 1975), known in political circles by the nickname UMAVAVA,[1] was a Rhodesian trade union leader, activist, and revolutionary. Born in Filabusi in Matabeleland, he attended mission and government schools and trained as a builder. He worked in Bulawayo, and became a union leader and African nationalist activist. In the 1950s and 60s, he served in leadership roles in the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, National Democratic Party, and Zimbabwe African People's Union. He was detained in 1964 and, with the exception of a three-week period the following year, was held in continuous detention for the next ten years. Upon his release in 1974, he was named Organising Secretary of the ANC, and attended the Victoria Falls Conference as part of Joshua Nkomo's delegation. He died shortly after in an automobile accident driving from Salisbury (now Harare) to Bulawayo.Early lifeNkala was born on 26 February 1927 in Filabusi, Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia.[2][3][4] He comes from a large Ndebele family; one of his siblings, Enos, also became active in the independence movement and later served in parliament and as a cabinet minister.[5] His father, Madika Nkala, was a peasant farmer, teacher at the local Methodist mission school, and later a cobbler.[6][7][8] His mother, Mbase Moyo, was a lay preacher of the American-led Brethren in Christ Church.[9] Nkala was raised in the Brethren faith and attended primary school Nkankezi School and at the Church's Matopo Mission.[10][11] He went on to study at Mzingwane High School in Essexvale (now Esigodini), where he became exposed to politics through fellow students, including Jason Moyo and others.[12][13] There, he received elementary industrial instruction, trained as a bricklayer, and qualified as a builder in 1947.[14][15]Career and political activityNkala worked in Bulawayo as a builder for many years.[16] In 1950, he was elected chairman of the Bulawayo branch of the African Artisans' Union.[17] He was elected president of the union in 1956, an office he held until his arrest in 1964.[18] He also served for some time as president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region.[19] He was also appointed Chairman of the Barbourfields Tenants' Association and member of the Bulawayo African Townships Advisory Board.[20]In 1957, Nkala joined the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, led by Joshua Nkomo, and served as treasurer for the organisation's Bulawayo branch until it was banned in 1959.[21] He was a prominent figure in the African nationalist movement in Bulawayo, and was briefly detained after a state of emergency was declared by the colonial government in February 1959.[22][23] He served as treasurer for the Bulawayo branch of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Nkomo's new party, from 1960 to 1961, when it, too, was banned.[24] From 1961 to 1963, Nkala was the Bulawayo district chairman for the NDP's successor, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU).[25] In 1962, ZAPU was banned, and the next year, some of its members broke away and formed Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's organisation, while his brother Enos joined ZANU.[26][27] From 1963 to 1964, he served as National Organising Secretary of the People's Caretaker Council, a newly-founded successor organisation to ZAPU that was the same in all but name.[28][29]On 23 April 1964, Nkala was detained by the Rhodesian government, and with the exception of a three-week period in April/May 1965, he remained in restriction or detention for over ten years.[30] He was initially held at Gonakudzingwa restriction camp, but because of his strong influence on the morale of his fellow restrictees, was moved, along with Nkomo and Joseph Msika, to Camp 5, a more isolated location.[31] There for four years, he had little human contact besides Nkomo and Msika, and began taking correspondence courses.[32] He passed his A Levels and went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in political science and public administration from the University of South Africa.[33][34] He was released on 3 December 1974.[35]In December 1974, Nkala was named to the Central Committee of the African National Council (ANC), and attended the Victoria Falls Conference in August 1975 along with Nkomo as part of the ANC delegation.[36][37] When the ANC split internally in September 1975, Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's faction, and was named organising secretary at the party's congress, held in Salisbury (now Harare) on 26 and 27 September 1975.[38]Death and legacyAround 2:30 p.m., 3 December 1975, exactly one year after his release from detention, Nkala was killed on the Salisbury-Bulawayo Road near Bembezi when his car overturned.[39][40][41][42] The ANC colleague he was traveling with, Aggrippah Moyo, was also killed.[43] A joint funeral held for Nkala and Moyo in Bulawayo was attended by thousands.[44][45] Joshua Nkomo spoke at the burial, stating that Nkala's and Moyo's death would not be in vain, and that Zimbabweans would achieve the independence the two died while fighting for.[46] Nkala left behind a widow and five children.[47] He was buried at Pelandaba Cemetery in Bulawayo, and was declared a national hero after independence in 1980.[48] In November 2019, 1st Avenue in Bulawayo was renamed Lazarus Nkala Avenue.[49][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about Nkala's marriage?"	"Nkala was married and had five children."
"Passage:  I think that people are inherently good. I strongly believe in the Golden Rule. I treat others as I would like to be treated: Holding doors open for those that I sense would have trouble. Giving up my seat to those that look as though they might need it: men, women, and the elderly. Being considerate! Saying thank you, and you're welcome! Thinking of others before myself. Writing ""thank you"" letters when appropriate. Not being mean to animals (perhaps excluding snakes and spiders unless they keep to themselves). I had always helped, and it felt good. But slowly, I began to notice things were changing. I still wanted to help others, but it was getting more difficult as I was passing the 3/4 of a century mark. I would tell my friends (just kidding) that I couldn't associate with people that old. When did I get this old? I have children over 50 and grandchildren over 20. Has society changed? Are its members less caring? I have heard this.I went to a take-out pizza establishment last week. Going in, I held open the door for a young lady who said ""thank you"", and when I entered, she insisted that I order before she did. The place was busy with little space to stand. When I picked up my order, I had to squeeze my way to the door as there was not much room, and I was having some trouble walking. As I got to the door, it opened. Automatic I thought. I looked down to find a boy of about ten holding it for me and smiling. ""Did I look that feeble?"" I thought. I said thank you, and he was smiling as he said ""your welcome."" No one had told him to do it. He was on his own. I think it made him feel good! Someone had taught him manners. It feels good to help others.Another pizza place I go to has a flight of stairs to overcome. Going up is not a problem, but going down with a pizza in hand is. One of the young employees asked if she could help. I said ""sure"". I went ahead, got in the car, and she handed it through the car window to me, all-the-while sporting a wide grin. Thanks, I said. You are welcome, she replied. Every time I get pizza and she is working, she immediately says ""I'll give it to you through the window."" I think it makes her feel as good as it does me!When I go to the grocery store, I buy 2-3 weeks of food because I don't know when I will have the energy again(pain when walking, but getting better). The box boys or girls will always ask if they can empty the shopping cart for me. Then they bag the groceries and ask if they can help me load them into the car. I always ask them if they can go home with me and unload them and put them away too. They smile, we joke. I ask them if they are still in school and where they are attending. They are always friendly. I say thank you and they say ""you're welcome"".When did I get old? I stopped playing competitive softball at 70 due to some injuries, but I received a call from one of my softball friends saying that he is forming an 80-year old competitive team and would like me to play on the team. It was nice of him to ask, and I do think he meant it. As soon as I get rid of my pain, I will start slowly working out again. My mind says yes, but my body isn't so sure. I am ""bird-walking""----getting off the subject now, so must get back on point.I had an appointment with a pain clinic. I knew the area well but had never seen the medical office. I had the address, but could not find any numbers on the buildings. My car does not have GPS(2002 model), and I was ten minutes late for the meeting. I had to park across the street in a dirt parking lot. The street had moderate traffic, but I managed to get across. The curb must have been at least 18-24 inches high. It seemed like an insurmountable wall, but by holding on to the front of a parked car, I managed to get up. Now there were four steps to climb and a heavy door to open. At the top of the stairs was a man of about 35 years old. He had tattoos on his arms and neck, and smiled at me and politely opened the door. I said thanks. I was told that other patients would have to be seen before me, and the wait might be an hour or more. I decided not to wait. I would go to the car, call my private doctor, tell him my pain situation and see if he would give me a shot for the it.As I left the pain center, the tattooed man stood at the base of the steps. He smiled again and asked me if I needed any help. Was he waiting for me to leave so he might mug me? I wobbled down the 4 steps and said no thank you, my car is just across the street. He said, ""You don't look as though you can go that far"". ""If you give me your keys, I will go over and get it for you."" I thought, ""Sure, then you will drive the car away."" My car was a 15-year old Hyundai SUV. I didn't trust him even though he had opened a door for me and smiled at the same time. Surely, he had devious intentions. ""This doesn't look good,"" I thought. So, I said, ""I can make it."" He backed off but watched as I tried to negotiate the 18 in curb. There was no car for me to grab for balance. He began to approach me again, and I began to sweat. There was no one else nearby. He put one arm around my waist and proceeded to lift me off the ground. Then, oh so gently, moved me off the curb and onto the street 18 inches below. ""I hope this helps,"" he said with a smile. ""I'll watch as you cross the street"", he said still smiling. I felt bad that I had jumped to conclusions and again said ""thanks"".I called my doctor whose office was 10 minutes away. His nurse told me that the doctor said to come in, and he wanted to know if she could give me the shot. I said that would be fine, but I will have a lot of trouble getting out of the car much less getting around to the office as the parking was in the back. He worked from the house that he had turned into his office. He was the only doctor that worked there. I had known him and his nurse for 25 years. She was cute and always in a good mood. She came to the back, needle in hand, had me open the driver's side door, had me pull one side of my pants down an inch exposing my left hip, and with great joy jammed the needle in it.""This doesn't look good!,"" I said smiling. ""People might get the wrong idea!"" She laughed, I smiled. This didn't look good, but neither did the fellow with the tattoo. This was all about people that I had met recently and the good that they had done, and how it feels to help others. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the kind acts people perform for the narrator."	"The narrator is helped by a young lady at a pizza place. She insists that the narrator order before she does. The narrator is helped by a boy of about ten at the pizza place. The narrator is helped by a young employee at a pizza place.

""I hope this helps,"" he said with a smile. ""I'll watch as you cross the street"", he said still smiling. I felt bad that I had jumped to conclusions and again said ""thanks"".I called my doctor whose office was 10 minutes away. His nurse told me that the doctor said to come in, and he wanted to know if she could give me the shot. I said that would be fine, but I will have a lot of trouble getting out of the car much less getting around to the office as the parking was in the back. He worked from the house that he had turned into his office. He was the only doctor that worked there. I had known him and his nurse for 25 years. She was cute and always in a good mood. She came to the back, needle in hand, had me open the driver's side door, had me pull one side of my pants down an inch exposing my left hip, and with great joy jammed the needle in it.""This doesn't look good!,"" I said smiling. ""People might get the wrong idea!"" She laughed, I smiled. This didn't look good, but neither did the fellow with the tattoo. This was all about people that I had met recently and the good that they had done, and how it feels to help others. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about what the narrator thinks of himself?"	"The narrator tries to help people and makes it a habit of going around doing these things because they believe it makes them feel better."
"Passage:  I think that people are inherently good. I strongly believe in the Golden Rule. I treat others as I would like to be treated: Holding doors open for those that I sense would have trouble. Giving up my seat to those that look as though they might need it: men, women, and the elderly. Being considerate! Saying thank you, and you're welcome! Thinking of others before myself. Writing ""thank you"" letters when appropriate. Not being mean to animals (perhaps excluding snakes and spiders unless they keep to themselves). I had always helped, and it felt good. But slowly, I began to notice things were changing. I still wanted to help others, but it was getting more difficult as I was passing the 3/4 of a century mark. I would tell my friends (just kidding) that I couldn't associate with people that old. When did I get this old? I have children over 50 and grandchildren over 20. Has society changed? Are its members less caring? I have heard this.I went to a take-out pizza establishment last week. Going in, I held open the door for a young lady who said ""thank you"", and when I entered, she insisted that I order before she did. The place was busy with little space to stand. When I picked up my order, I had to squeeze my way to the door as there was not much room, and I was having some trouble walking. As I got to the door, it opened. Automatic I thought. I looked down to find a boy of about ten holding it for me and smiling. ""Did I look that feeble?"" I thought. I said thank you, and he was smiling as he said ""your welcome."" No one had told him to do it. He was on his own. I think it made him feel good! Someone had taught him manners. It feels good to help others.Another pizza place I go to has a flight of stairs to overcome. Going up is not a problem, but going down with a pizza in hand is. One of the young employees asked if she could help. I said ""sure"". I went ahead, got in the car, and she handed it through the car window to me, all-the-while sporting a wide grin. Thanks, I said. You are welcome, she replied. Every time I get pizza and she is working, she immediately says ""I'll give it to you through the window."" I think it makes her feel as good as it does me!When I go to the grocery store, I buy 2-3 weeks of food because I don't know when I will have the energy again(pain when walking, but getting better). The box boys or girls will always ask if they can empty the shopping cart for me. Then they bag the groceries and ask if they can help me load them into the car. I always ask them if they can go home with me and unload them and put them away too. They smile, we joke. I ask them if they are still in school and where they are attending. They are always friendly. I say thank you and they say ""you're welcome"".When did I get old? I stopped playing competitive softball at 70 due to some injuries, but I received a call from one of my softball friends saying that he is forming an 80-year old competitive team and would like me to play on the team. It was nice of him to ask, and I do think he meant it. As soon as I get rid of my pain, I will start slowly working out again. My mind says yes, but my body isn't so sure. I am ""bird-walking""----getting off the subject now, so must get back on point.I had an appointment with a pain clinic. I knew the area well but had never seen the medical office. I had the address, but could not find any numbers on the buildings. My car does not have GPS(2002 model), and I was ten minutes late for the meeting. I had to park across the street in a dirt parking lot. The street had moderate traffic, but I managed to get across. The curb must have been at least 18-24 inches high. It seemed like an insurmountable wall, but by holding on to the front of a parked car, I managed to get up. Now there were four steps to climb and a heavy door to open. At the top of the stairs was a man of about 35 years old. He had tattoos on his arms and neck, and smiled at me and politely opened the door. I said thanks. I was told that other patients would have to be seen before me, and the wait might be an hour or more. I decided not to wait. I would go to the car, call my private doctor, tell him my pain situation and see if he would give me a shot for the it.As I left the pain center, the tattooed man stood at the base of the steps. He smiled again and asked me if I needed any help. Was he waiting for me to leave so he might mug me? I wobbled down the 4 steps and said no thank you, my car is just across the street. He said, ""You don't look as though you can go that far"". ""If you give me your keys, I will go over and get it for you."" I thought, ""Sure, then you will drive the car away."" My car was a 15-year old Hyundai SUV. I didn't trust him even though he had opened a door for me and smiled at the same time. Surely, he had devious intentions. ""This doesn't look good,"" I thought. So, I said, ""I can make it."" He backed off but watched as I tried to negotiate the 18 in curb. There was no car for me to grab for balance. He began to approach me again, and I began to sweat. There was no one else nearby. He put one arm around my waist and proceeded to lift me off the ground. Then, oh so gently, moved me off the curb and onto the street 18 inches below.

"Passage: THRILLOPOLIS was a planned amusement park that was to have been built by Themeparks LLC in the early 2000s. The park was planned to be built in Nashville, Tennessee, near the Adelphia Coliseum. The project was announced in 2002, and was projected to open in 2005. The park was originally planned to be located at an 82-acre site near the Adelphia Coliseum on the banks of the Cumberland River, but after conflicts with the local government, Themeparks LLC planned to build the park in Wilson County. The project was scrapped around 2004-05.HistoryDowntown Nashville proposalIn the early 2000s, Themeparks LLC, who were operating Magic Springs and Crystal Falls in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and had sold Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky to Premier Parks in 1997, were looking to expand. The company began working on plans for an amusement park that was to be built in Nashville, Tennessee, a city that had not had any major amusement parks since Opryland USA closed in December 1997.[1] On April 25, 2002, Ed Hart, the CEO of Themeparks LLC, pitched the concept for a Nashville-based theme park called Thrillopolis to Mayor Bill Purcell and the Nashville Chamber of Commerce. Thrillopolis was planned to be built on an 82-acre industrial site, owned by the Steiner Liff Iron and Metal Company, on the banks of the Cumberland River and next to the Adelphia Coliseum.[2] Construction was to begin in late 2002, and the park was going to open in 2005. During the proposal, Themeparks LLC estimated that the park's construction would cost $193 million, the company wanted $127 million in public financing which they would back with a $100 million letter of credit. Maria Partlow, vice president of marketing for Themeparks LLC, said, “We have to have a public-private partnership, that is the model for how these parks work now.”[3]Several Nashville council members publicly showed opposition for the planned amusement park. Council member J.B. Loring said the proposal “simply doesn’t fit in with the progress of Nashville at all,” and he said that every council member he spoke to agreed with his opinion that the plan was “ridiculous.” Council member Ron Nollner said that the proposal was “Out of the question, In my book, that’s not doable."" John Summers, another council member, said that Nashville “shouldn’t be the funding of first resort for a speculative business. If the business doesn’t work out, the city is at risk. Meanwhile, extending the lending capacity to amusement park developers means we have less lending capacity for our real needs, like schools.”[4] Mayor Purcell also showed opposition to the amusement park, saying ""Everyone thinks that it would be nice for us to have a theme park, the question is, should we take $127 million in public resources and put it to that use?” Purcell mentioned that he didn't understand why Hart wanted public funding when he didn't seek a bank loan, saying “For returns that are certain, there is a great amount of capital in a market system like ours. For people with ideas to come to a city asking for funding, that usually means that private investors have concluded that it doesn’t meet their standard of risk.” Hart said that he needed credit from the city, because “financing an amusement park of this size privately would mean taking on too much debt.”[5]Many people were also opposed to the park's proposed location, next to the Adelphia Coliseum and Downtown Nashville. Because of the area's proximity to Downtown Nashville, many were worried about the park's affect on the city's aesthetic, as it would become a noticeable part of Nashville's skyline.[6]On June 17, 2002, Themeparks LLC announced that the 82-acre riverfront site in Nashville was no longer under consideration as a possible site for Thrillopolis. During the announcement, Hart said that “the company is looking at various other locations in Nashville-Davidson County, as well as in the greater Middle Tennessee region, as potential sites for a park,” Hart continued, saying “It has become apparent that there are divergent opinions about the best use of the Steiner Liff site that do not appear to be reconcilable any time in the near future,"" adding “Despite our confidence in the initial financing plan, we understand Metro’s concern about assuming credit risk. We look forward to continued discussions with Mayor Purcell to meet his criteria as well as our own.”[7]Wilson County proposalOn September 18, 2002, The Wilson County Economic Development Board confirmed that Themeparks LLC was looking at several Wilson County sites. Many people in Wilson County were excited that Thrillopolis could be built in the area, one resident said “Maybe it'd save them from raising our taxes again. We'd get out-of-state money coming in.”[8] During preliminary discussions with Wilson County officials, Hart mentioned that a scaled-down version of the park would be built. Unlike the Nashville proposal, a water park would be built first, and then expand to add amusement rides.[9] On October 15, 2002, Themeparks LLC announced that they had signed an exclusivity agreement with Wilson County for the development of a theme park. Under the one-year covenant, the two moved forward with a feasibility study to project the potential economic benefits of a public-private partnership.[10] However, Themeparks LLC decided not to build an amusement park in Tennessee, and Thrillopolis was canceled around 2004-05.During an interview in April 2014, Hart talked about Thrillopolis, he said “I was interested in opening up a theme park in Nashville, and Opryland had closed, and we tried to work that out with a number of city and state officials. We were at it for about two or three years, but it didn't work out, and some things don't, but it would have been interesting for Nashville to once again have had a nice regional theme park.”[11][1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about the level of opposition against the proposed Thrillopolis amusement park?"	"The proposed Thrillopolis amusement park was met with some opposition from the Nashville council members. Council member J.B.

"Passage:   They say that we are all the heroes of our own stories, but I'd beg to differ. What if we were made to be the sidekick for other's success stories? I thought this was kind of stupid too, until I began to really think about it and reflect on my life. I began to find similarities between my story and Joey's from Yugioh or Brock from Pokémon; yes, I had my own accomplishments but ultimately, I couldn’t see the direction I needed to go in to complete my story, I just seem to be floating around hopping from story to story helping others on their quest with no clear end game for me.    My name is Caleb Dudley, I'm a 20-year-old Male living in Florida and this is the story of how I became a sidekick.I started my life as most American kids do; going to school, making friends and not caring about anything except when P.E was. I went to multiple nice schools, not really fitting in anywhere, I was always the outsider, the expendable kid. Not only was I aggressive to my teachers/school staff, there were very few people I really trusted. Looking back at it now I’d say it was because my father wasn’t there much, and my step dad influenced my mother to create a abusive household- hell on earth in the middle of a suburb. I think the only thing that kept me from truly snapping was my childhood best friend Vikram. I can’t thank him enough for keeping me grounded in some of the hardest times of my life. I can see that he was the first hero I became the sidekick for. He was the brains and I was the brawn, we were unstoppable in anything we did.In 4th grade my mother moved us to San Antonio Texas for her work, away from my friends and from my dad I had nothing. This is where I had to develop myself; something snapped in me and I suddenly stopped being aggressive and I stopped crying but I still felt alone. I did find new friends but I knew they only befriended me because I was an outsider and an outsider I would continue to be.5th grade we moved back to Florida where I attended my old elementary school and was accepted into a International Baccalaureate middle school. This school was supposed to be a government implemented program where they take “gifted” kids from all over the city and put them in a school in the middle of bad neighborhoods. To me things were looking up, we moved back into our old house, I had my friends again and I had my hero again to help me through my shitty living situation. This all came crashing down when I started middle school.See because I had to go to this neighborhood for school I spent about 4 hours of my day on a bus with other kids, both in middle school and high school, in my situation. I thought everything was going great; the same kids who knew about my troubled elementary school years were going to the local middle school, so this was a clean slate. My feelings were affirmed when I started school, for reasons unknown I became the class clown and everyone knew me as such. By 8th grade I was on top of the school, I even became close with most of the cliques in the school; being the glue that made our class so close. This, unfortunately, became the only happiness I had in my life at the time. My best friend, being 2 years older than me and having strict parents, was busy making the most of his high school years, destined to do great things as any hero should. The 4 hours I spent on the bus everyday became my 2nd hell but was also where I met my 2nd hero. My bus ride was where I was bullied almost every single day, they couldn’t make fun of my clothes because there was a uniform requirement at my school but they made fun of everything else they could, sometimes even resorting to physical violence. To this day I hate thinking about my time on that bus. I was ultimately the damsel in distress, which is where my hero came into play. In 8th grade a new high schooler rode our bus named Valarie, just by talking to her you could tell she was a social outcast, just the person to not give a fuck about others opinions. She became my new hero, someone who would help me through 8th grade and protect me from the kids on the bus while I became her sidekick, someone who would be there to talk to her and make her laugh. You probably get the point by now: I remain a social outcast, I get bullied some more, I find a new hero, I move, repeat. You’re probably bored with this post by now and I don’t blame you. This looks like one big sob story to be honest.  I guess the only reason I made this was to warn everyone to not be a sidekick like me. I need help, I need a new hero.

"Passage: ’MARTEINN EINARSSON (died 7 October 1576) was bishop of Skálholt from 1548 to 1556. He was the second Lutheran bishop and was directly involved in the Icelandic Reformation.Early lifeMarteinn was born in Staðarstaður on the Snæfellsnes peninsula to the poet Einar Ölduhryggjarskáld and Ingiríður Jónsdóttir. Marteinn's family had a tradition of serving as priests. His father, Einar, was a priest in Staðarstaður from about 1500 until his death in 1538, and Ingiríður's brother, , had served as bishop of Skálholt from 1491 to 1518. Marteinn's siblings included the sheriffs and Brandur Einarsson, known as Gleraugna-Pétur and Moldar-Brandur respectively, as well as a sister, Guðrún, the wife of the magistrate Daði Guðmundsson.Marteinn spent nine years studying in England, where another of his sisters lived after marrying an Englishman, before returning to Iceland to work as a merchant in Grindavík.BishopIn 1533, Marteinn became a priest, serving in Staðarstaður after his father's death. He was an early supporter of the Reformation, and in 1548, Marteinn was elected bishop of Skálholt after the death of Gissur Einarsson, the first Lutheran bishop in Iceland. [1] Despite an effort by the Catholic bishop Jón Arason, the primary opponent of the spread of Protestantism in Iceland, to have named bishop instead, Marteinn was consecrated in Denmark as bishop of Skálholt on 7 April 1549.[2]Upon his return to Iceland that summer, Marteinn was arrested by Jón's sons, Ara and Björn Jónsson, who detained him at Ara's farm at Möðrufell. Marteinn remained detained until after the Battle of Sauðafell in 1550, where Daði Guðmundsson defeated Jón Arason, ending organized Catholic resistance to the Reformation, at which time he formally took control of the bishopric of Skálholt.[3]In 1555, Marteinn published the first Icelandic hymnal, _Lítið Psálmakver_.[4] Marteinn served as bishop until 1557, when he resigned in protest of claims by the king decision to appropriate church tithes.[5] He returned to Staðarstaður where he served as a priest until his retirement in 1569.Personal lifeMarteinn was married to Ingibjörg, whose father's name is unknown. They had four sons and two daughters. Marteinn lived out his retirement in where he published a collection of psalms and was considered a good painter, although none of his paintings are known to survive.[6] He died in 1756.FictionMarteinn appears in Ólafur Gunnarsson's 2003 historical novel _Öxin og jörðin_ (translated into English as _The Ax and the Earth_), which is set amid Jón Arason's struggle against the Icelandic Reformation.[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:When did Marteinn Einarsson live?"	"He died in 1576. It is not said when he was born."
"Passage: *Loosely based on an event that happened to me today.*The engines of my Cadillac let out a final roar as it dies down. I carefully open the door and slowly drag myself out of the car. I take a moment to observe my surroundings. I am standing on top of 'Sterling Cliff,' named after the man who discovered it. It's really a popular hangout spot for high schoolers like me (though I don't use it to hangout), but being that it's winter break, I seem to be alone for the time being. If you take the underpass off of route 20 and keep going straight until you see a **DO NOT ENTER** sign, you'd be where I am now. I dare not look down, though I wouldn't mind if an accident were to have me greet the rubble a few miles down. Today's been a rough day. I climb onto the roof of my car and let my legs dangle over the windshield. I fish my pockets for a cigarette to calm my nerves, but I find nothing. I always carry a vaporizer, however, in case I find myself in the situation I am in currently. They say these devices are supposed to be safer than cigarettes. I guess I'll choose the poison that kills me the slowest.I take out the vaporizer from my breast pocket and fiddle with it as I look out into the sky. The sky glows with a red-orange hue, as if the sky has been set on fire. The clouds and rich colors permeating the sky coalesce to form a scene right out of a painting by Monet. Little stars soon appear to dot the sky, though they are enveloped by the large, dark clouds beginning to form. Though this beautiful scenery surrounds me, I feel nothing. There's a void in my life that needs to be filled, or so it seems. I take a long drag from my vaporizer. A deep exhale follows as I watch the strawberry flavored smoke rise up until it kisses the sky and disappears. Truly surreal. I feel something cold and wet hit my shoulder. Suddenly, a flurry of snow begins to descend upon me and the sky changes color accordingly to a depressing dark-blue color. Atleast the dreary weather matches my mood now. I feel the snow melt on my dark, silky hair, which reminds me, I forgot to bring a jacket. I take another puff of my vaporizer and let the chemicals seep into my brain. I still don't feel anything, but I sense I'm more placid and lethargic than when I arrived here. I wish I could just curl up into a ball and sleep. Slowly the world will forget about me. I would never achieve success, but I would not experience failure. It's a fair trade-off to me. I could shirk my responsibilities and live on my own accord. There's too much uncertainty in my future. Too many expectations placed on me. I wish I could transcend this body and live amongst the stars. I place the vaporizer to my mouth and inhale, letting the strawberry vapor dance on my tongue, and exhale once again. I see my smoke exit my cold lips and realize that it's stopped snowing. The clouds have parted to reveal a sky bespeckled with stars and a lone crescent moon. I remember when I was young, I used to chase the moon, thinking one day I could reach out and grab it for myself. I don't remember why I wanted it so bad though. Maybe it was so I could impress my peers during show-and-tell. Maybe it was because I knew a lifeless piece of rock would treat me better than those that have surrounded me my entire life. I let out a yawn as I'm ruminating and realize it's only the bright moonlight that's keeping me awake. I jump down the roof of my car and enter it. The car howls into submission, a noise matched only by the gust of wind outside, as I enter the key into the ignition and drive away home.

"Passage:  This article is more than 2 YEARS OLDSales bested 2017’s 17% increase over Labor Day, according to Edison Trends, despite Trump’s protests of the campaignThe Nike ad starring Colin Kaepernick does not appear to have adversely affected sales, an analyst said on Saturday.According to Edison Trends, a digital commerce research company: “Nike sales grew 31% from Sunday through Tuesday over Labor Day this year, besting 2017’s comparative 17% increase.”The sportswear giant released the first version of its ad on Monday, the Labor Day holiday. It featured the quarterback and the slogan: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it.”Kaepernick, 30, has been without a team since opting out of his San Francisco 49ers contract in March 2017. In 2016 he was an originator of protests by NFL players, targeting racial injustice and police brutality, which often involve kneeling during the pre-game playing of the national anthem.Donald Trump has made the protests a key part of his appeal to his base, arguing that the players are disrespecting the anthem, the US flag and the military.On Tuesday, the president told the rightwing website Daily Caller: “I think it’s a terrible message that [Nike] are sending and the purpose of them doing it, maybe there’s a reason for them doing it. But I think as far as sending a message, I think it’s a terrible message and a message that shouldn’t be sent. There’s no reason for it.”He also said Nike paid him “a lot of rent” in New York and admitted that the protests and the Nike ad were “in another way … what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do”.“But I personally am on a different side of it,” Trump said.In the following days, the president pursued the issue via Twitter. On Wednesday, he wrote: “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!”Trump did not supply evidence for his claim of “anger and boycotts” but opposition to the company’s move was expressed widely and in some instances creatively on social media.On Friday, the morning after the full version of the Nike ad played during the Philadelphia Eagles v Atlanta Falcons NFL season opener, the president asked: “What was Nike thinking?”Nike releases full ad featuring Colin Kaepernick - videoEdison Trends’ analysis suggested the company will be thinking its gambit has worked, allowing it to surf familiar controversy and create a “Trump bump” all of its own.“Nike’s 2018 late summer sales show much the same trend as last year’s,” the company wrote, “with order volume decreasing slightly going into late August. The similarity decreases coming out of Labor Day weekend, however, with sales seeing a bigger bump on Monday and Tuesday than in the past.”Edison Trends said its analysis was based on “anonymised and aggregated e-receipts from more than 3 million consumers”.The NFL has not resolved how to respond to or govern the protests, which were widely discussed again on Thursday after Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett sat down before the anthem had finished.In July, in an open letter to league owners, the NBA great and Guardian sports columnist Kareem Abdul Jabbar wrote: “It’s been two years since Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest systemic racial injustice, especially police brutality, against people of color.“The worst thing about that isn’t that two years later we’re still debating whether players have the right to protest, it’s that not much has changed regarding what Kaepernick was protesting.” Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the arguments against Kaepernick."

"Passage:  I think that people are inherently good. I strongly believe in the Golden Rule. I treat others as I would like to be treated: Holding doors open for those that I sense would have trouble. Giving up my seat to those that look as though they might need it: men, women, and the elderly. Being considerate! Saying thank you, and you're welcome! Thinking of others before myself. Writing ""thank you"" letters when appropriate. Not being mean to animals (perhaps excluding snakes and spiders unless they keep to themselves). I had always helped, and it felt good. But slowly, I began to notice things were changing. I still wanted to help others, but it was getting more difficult as I was passing the 3/4 of a century mark. I would tell my friends (just kidding) that I couldn't associate with people that old. When did I get this old? I have children over 50 and grandchildren over 20. Has society changed? Are its members less caring? I have heard this.I went to a take-out pizza establishment last week. Going in, I held open the door for a young lady who said ""thank you"", and when I entered, she insisted that I order before she did. The place was busy with little space to stand. When I picked up my order, I had to squeeze my way to the door as there was not much room, and I was having some trouble walking. As I got to the door, it opened. Automatic I thought. I looked down to find a boy of about ten holding it for me and smiling. ""Did I look that feeble?"" I thought. I said thank you, and he was smiling as he said ""your welcome."" No one had told him to do it. He was on his own. I think it made him feel good! Someone had taught him manners. It feels good to help others.Another pizza place I go to has a flight of stairs to overcome. Going up is not a problem, but going down with a pizza in hand is. One of the young employees asked if she could help. I said ""sure"". I went ahead, got in the car, and she handed it through the car window to me, all-the-while sporting a wide grin. Thanks, I said. You are welcome, she replied. Every time I get pizza and she is working, she immediately says ""I'll give it to you through the window."" I think it makes her feel as good as it does me!When I go to the grocery store, I buy 2-3 weeks of food because I don't know when I will have the energy again(pain when walking, but getting better). The box boys or girls will always ask if they can empty the shopping cart for me. Then they bag the groceries and ask if they can help me load them into the car. I always ask them if they can go home with me and unload them and put them away too. They smile, we joke. I ask them if they are still in school and where they are attending. They are always friendly. I say thank you and they say ""you're welcome"".When did I get old? I stopped playing competitive softball at 70 due to some injuries, but I received a call from one of my softball friends saying that he is forming an 80-year old competitive team and would like me to play on the team. It was nice of him to ask, and I do think he meant it. As soon as I get rid of my pain, I will start slowly working out again. My mind says yes, but my body isn't so sure. I am ""bird-walking""----getting off the subject now, so must get back on point.I had an appointment with a pain clinic. I knew the area well but had never seen the medical office. I had the address, but could not find any numbers on the buildings. My car does not have GPS(2002 model), and I was ten minutes late for the meeting. I had to park across the street in a dirt parking lot. The street had moderate traffic, but I managed to get across. The curb must have been at least 18-24 inches high. It seemed like an insurmountable wall, but by holding on to the front of a parked car, I managed to get up. Now there were four steps to climb and a heavy door to open. At the top of the stairs was a man of about 35 years old. He had tattoos on his arms and neck, and smiled at me and politely opened the door. I said thanks. I was told that other patients would have to be seen before me, and the wait might be an hour or more. I decided not to wait. I would go to the car, call my private doctor, tell him my pain situation and see if he would give me a shot for the it.As I left the pain center, the tattooed man stood at the base of the steps. He smiled again and asked me if I needed any help. Was he waiting for me to leave so he might mug me? I wobbled down the 4 steps and said no thank you, my car is just across the street. He said, ""You don't look as though you can go that far"". ""If you give me your keys, I will go over and get it for you."" I thought, ""Sure, then you will drive the car away."" My car was a 15-year old Hyundai SUV. I didn't trust him even though he had opened a door for me and smiled at the same time. Surely, he had devious intentions. ""This doesn't look good,"" I thought. So, I said, ""I can make it."" He backed off but watched as I tried to negotiate the 18 in curb. There was no car for me to grab for balance. He began to approach me again, and I began to sweat. There was no one else nearby. He put one arm around my waist and proceeded to lift me off the ground. Then, oh so gently, moved me off the curb and onto the street 18 inches below. ""I hope this helps,"" he said with a smile. ""I'll watch as you cross the street"", he said still smiling. I felt bad that I had jumped to conclusions and again said ""thanks"".I called my doctor whose office was 10 minutes away. His nurse told me that the doctor said to come in, and he wanted to know if she could give me the shot. I said that would be fine, but I will have a lot of trouble getting out of the car much less getting around to the office as the parking was in the back. He worked from the house that he had turned into his office. He was the only doctor that worked there. I had known him and his nurse for 25 years. She was cute and always in a good mood. She came to the back, needle in hand, had me open the driver's side door, had me pull one side of my pants down an inch exposing my left hip, and with great joy jammed the needle in it.""This doesn't look good!,"" I said smiling. ""People might get the wrong idea!"" She laughed, I smiled. This didn't look good, but neither did the fellow with the tattoo. This was all about people that I had met recently and the good that they had done, and how it feels to help others. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about strangers?"	"The narrator has a positive experience with a stranger when he helps him off a curb. The stranger helps him to his car. The narrator is suspicious of the stranger's motives. He is helped by him in the parking lot of a pain clinic. The narrator feels bad for jumping to conclusions about the stranger's motives and is grateful for the stranger's help."
"Passage: Women who are not entirely straight or gay tend to have slightly higher levels of psychopathic traits and a more casual attitude towards sex, according to new research published in the journal _Evolutionary Psychological Science_. The study also provides more evidence that bisexuality is a distinct sexual orientation in women.“I was mainly interested in this topic because certain patterns seemed to be accruing in the academic literature regarding bisexual individuals, and bisexual women in particular. Bisexual women differ in some important ways––such as personality, sex drive, and relative openness to casual sex––from both their heterosexual and their lesbian counterparts,” said Scott W. Semenyna of University of Lethbridge, the corresponding author of the study.“My specific interest in the overlap between sexual orientation, Dark Triad traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism), and sociosexuality sprang from two key findings. First, bisexual women report elevated sociosexuality (i.e., greater comfort with, desire for, and engagement in uncommitted sexual activity) compared to both heterosexual or lesbian women. Second, bisexual women report slightly lower levels of two personality traits––honesty/humility, and conscientiousness––than other sexual orientation groups.”“These personality traits have both been related to higher levels of Dark Triad traits, and also greater sociosexuality,” Semenyna told PsyPost. “These past findings suggest that female sexual orientation may share some unique relationships with both personality, and sexuality related variables, and I wanted to dig deeper into those potential connections.”The researchers found that bisexual women tended to score higher on measures of sociosexuality and psychopathy than strictly heterosexual and lesbian women.The findings were based on two surveys of a total of 1,093 female students at a Midwestern Canadian University. The study utilized the Kinsey scale of sexual attraction, which ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. In the very middle of the scale are individuals who are mostly heterosexual, equally heterosexual and homosexual, and mostly homosexual.“The big-picture take away from this study is that sociosexuality shares a curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship with female sexual orientation,” Semenyna explained. “Heterosexual and lesbian women don’t tend to differ from one another in their relative caution towards uncommitted sexual activity. Women towards the middle of the sexual orientation spectrum, especially those who are ‘moderately bisexual,’ are somewhat less cautious about uncommitted sexual activity.”“Alongside these shifts in sociosexuality are shifts in some Dark Triad personality traits, particularly psychopathy,” Semenyna told PsyPost. “These shifts are subtle, only about as large as typical sex differences in the traits, but they’re interesting. (Men typically score higher in all Dark Triad traits, as well as interest in casual sex, than do women.)”“Primarily such evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that female bisexuality and female homosexuality are the result of different developmental processes. If female bisexuality and homosexuality were simply the result of the same underlying developmental processes, one would expect that any differences between heterosexual and bisexual women in personality or interest in casual sex would be even larger when comparing heterosexual and lesbian women.”“Instead, what we observe is that lesbian and heterosexual women don’t differ in these variables, despite drastic difference in who they are sexually attracted to,” Semenyna said. “On the other hand, bisexual women are higher in these traits than heterosexual or lesbian women, while being attracted to some degree to both males and females.”The study does have some limitations.“While research into female sexuality and women’s sexual orientation has grown in the last few decades, we are in desperate need of more data to bridge the substantial gaps in our understanding,” Semenyna remarked.“The biggest caveat in the present study is that the sexual orientation differences in psychopathy have not yet been replicated. The study adds support to other findings that bisexual women are more interested in casual sex, and engage in it more often (often with men). Other aspects of the study require replication, ideally by independent researchers.”“The other caveat is that this study was conducted on an extremely WEIRD sample (i.e., Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). It’s unclear whether these differences apply only to university students, if similar differences may exist in the general population, or what possible cross-cultural variation exists in these patterns,” Semenyna said.“The cross-sectional nature of the study also prevents any causal connections from being drawn. First we have to establish these potential differences as reliable, then we have to interpret why these difference may exist and what they mean. In short, this study is an extremely small thread in a large tapestry that is slowly being woven, but is far from complete.”Semenyna also emphasized that the study should not be misinterpreted as an attack on bisexuality or bisexual women.“I’ve seen certain criticisms online of the study that it suggests that bisexual women are ‘slutty,’ or that we are trying to paint bisexual women in a negative light. Essentially the research is being accused of being ‘biphobic,'” he explained.“I think this is unfortunate for several reasons. The first of which is that the purpose of science is to investigate and understand, and report results regardless of how well they fit our preconceptions and preferences. Scientific investigation of sexual minorities is an important step towards greater understanding, and ultimately greater acceptance.”“The second reason is that I don’t see anything inherently wrong with people being comfortable with and pursuing casual sexual behavior, and having the freedom to do so. The sexual orientation differences in sociosexuality, as well as psychopathy, are only about as large as the typical sex differences found in these traits, with men on average scoring slightly higher than women on average,” Semenyna said.“To suggest that these differences in sociosexuality or psychopathy paint bisexual women in a negative light is to simultaneously smear men, who similarly score higher than heterosexual women on these traits. To view normal variation (i.e., diversity) in human personality and sexual behavior as somehow problematic is ultimately counterproductive to both scientific progress on these topics, and social acceptance.”The study, “Not Straight and Not Straightforward: the Relationships Between Sexual Orientation, Sociosexuality, and Dark Triad Traits in Women“, Charlene F.

"Passage: Women who are not entirely straight or gay tend to have slightly higher levels of psychopathic traits and a more casual attitude towards sex, according to new research published in the journal _Evolutionary Psychological Science_. The study also provides more evidence that bisexuality is a distinct sexual orientation in women.“I was mainly interested in this topic because certain patterns seemed to be accruing in the academic literature regarding bisexual individuals, and bisexual women in particular. Bisexual women differ in some important ways––such as personality, sex drive, and relative openness to casual sex––from both their heterosexual and their lesbian counterparts,” said Scott W.

"Passage: David Davis will tell business leaders in Austria that fears the Conservatives will plunge Britain into a “Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction” after leaving the EU are unfounded.The Brexit secretary will claim that Theresa May’s government wants to oversee a race to the top in global standards, listing workers’ rights, City regulation, animal welfare and the environment as areas for potential improvement.In the latest speech in the government’s “road to Brexit” series, Davis will say: “We will continue our track record of meeting high standards after we leave the European Union. Now, I know that for one reason or another there are some people who have sought to question that these really are our intentions … these fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing – not history, not intention nor interest.”British officials highlighted a recent warning in a European commission presentation to member states relating to workplace safety standards that appeared to suggest UK workers could be at higher risk of cancer after Brexit.One slide suggested that the UK might cut “levels of occupational safety and health” leading to “higher exposure to chemicals and carcinogens”, and that workers could have their consultation rights cut to reduce delays for collective dismissals.Davis will use the speech to hit back at that suggestion, outlining UK hopes that “mutual recognition” of regulations will continue after Brexit.He will add: “They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom. With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not history, not intention, nor interest.”The minister’s attempt to reassure critics of the process for leaving the EU follow comments from Damian Green, until recently the prime minister’s de facto deputy, that could ramp up tensions over Brexit within the Conservative party.In a BBC Radio 4 documentary, he questioned the ability of some pro-Brexit colleagues to “accept evidence” of the economic risks of leaving the EU, and said the government ought to publish such analysis in full after it is produced.“I do reject all the conspiracy theories that suggest there’s some sort of plot inside the official machine to thwart the will of the people,” added Green, after a row in parliament in which high-profile Tory MPs questioned the impartiality of civil servants.Davis’s speech on standards sets out some of the key issues to be discussed by cabinet ministers at May’s Chequers away day on Thursday.The team, which includes ardent Brexiters and others who campaigned to remain, are coalescing around the idea of a system in which Britain will argue in favour of aligning with the EU in some areas but immediately diverging in others.Davis’s reassurances on continued high standards coincide with a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research that suggests minimal support for deregulation.An IPPR/Opinium poll found that more than 60% of the public want to retain or tighten the rules on vehicle fuel emissions, rising to more than 70% for renewable energy targets, the working time directive and a cap on bankers’ bonuses, and more than 80% for consumer cancellation rights. Only a tiny proportion say they would be happy to relax or remove such conditions.The report, which argues in favour of staying closer to the European model of trade rather than the US one, also warns that there are signs that the UK wants to deregulate.It highlights: the fact that the EU largely sets minimum standards not maximum ones; that many senior figures have argued strongly in favour of deregulation; and that the UK may not have the resources to keep up with changes to EU regulations after Brexit so will converge “by accident rather than design”.It also says that the UK, as a “mid-sized economy”, can only maximise its trading benefits by aligning to a larger bloc, with the EU or US being the obvious options.Tom Kibasi, the director of the IPPR, said: “Our research shows there is no appetite for deregulation post-Brexit. Regulatory divergence is both anti-worker and anti-business, so it should be no surprise that the public don’t want it.“Our proposal for the ‘shared market’, where Britain and the single market would be aligned and in a customs union, remains the best way to secure our economic interests while honouring the vote to leave.”Government officials admitted that Davis’s call for “higher standards” did not mean there would be no deregulation, suggesting that Brexit would allow the UK to regulate in a different manner.One senior EU diplomat said everyone wanted frictionless trade, and that it would arguably help if the UK adopted EU standards on a broad scale.“But even with this, this will not alter the fact that there will be a border between us. And that there will be enforcement of such a border in terms of not only tariffs, but verification that the UK actually meets the standards they need to export into the EU,” he said, also listing checks for counterfeited goods or trafficking.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, will also stress the benefits of high standards in a speech to the manufacturing industry on Tuesday, calling UK-produced goods “a kitemark of quality, innovation and world-leading technological advances”.Fox will tell business leaders at the EEF conference that there will be a “functioning trade regime on day one” after Brexit.

However, in order to understand these systems, we have to recognize several important hypotheses that were validated during the Private Alpha and Open Beta :1.      Not all writers and peer reviewers are equally competent2.      Content quality increases with greater writing and peer reviewing competency3.      Users contribution increases with greater rewardsUnderstanding Writing Competency (WC) or Peer Review Competency (PRC) is critical to building a high quality knowledge base. Average Writing Competency and Average Peer Review Competency are closely correlated with content quality.If five peer reviewers with low competency are matched together, then the resulting content will be low quality.[Image for post]However, when 5 peer reviewers with high competency are matched together, then the resulting content will be high quality.[Image for post]However, there is a sweet spot occurs when the average peer review competency is greater than a minimum threshold. The minimum threshold should be enough to enable a wider range of competencies while still ensuring a minimum standard of quality.[Image for post]In the Nebula Release, we will aim to raise the PRC through system upgradesEDUCATION AND EXAM REQUIREMENTSWe’ll create best practices, guidelines, and competency tests to ensure that writers and peer reviewers have the knowledge required to perform at the highest competency level.SMART PEER REVIEW MATCHMAKING SYSTEMThe future Peer Review System will more intelligently match peer reviewers together to exceed a minimum threshold of the Average Peer Review Competency.RELEVANT CONTENT RANDOMIZATIONThe random peer review selection will consider a peer reviewer’s interests and competence in a certain topic.ASSISTED WRITING AND PEER REVIEW EXPERIENCEThe writing and peer review experience will be guided with interactive human-computer interaction. All the interactions where a Chief Editor would normally interact with a writer and/or peer reviewer to ensure that expectations are being met during the creative process are being replaced with our Assisted Technology. In the future, Machine Learning may be used to better fine-tune the experience to the individual needs of the writer or peer reviewer. This Assisted Writing and Peer Review Experience will occur in what we’re calling our Intelligent Editor 1.0 and Peer Review Guidance 1.0.CONTENT VALIDATIONThe Editor is getting an upgrade which will check to ensure that the writing requirements are being met. In the future, we will add pre-processing and post-processing steps to ensure that the content is processed to a higher quality along the content production process.DEVELOPMENT RELEASESSEARCH UPGRADEWe have upgraded the search on Lunyr. It is now 100x faster than before and predicts relevant search results.UPCOMING MOBILE RELEASEThe dedicated mobile version of Lunyr will finally be released. We’re proud to showcase our progress so far!Writers will be able to write in the mobile version. Previously, writing was only available on desktop.[Image for post]The Article Viewer features a minimalistic view that is easy to read.[Image for post]There will be a feed that allows writers and peer reviewers to stay updated with all the recent Lunyr events.[Image for post][Image for post]The Mobile User profile allows writers to show off their work in a beautiful view.[Image for post]Users can more easily check and transfer their Ethereum, LUN, and Points.[Image for post]Advertisers can stay updated with the progress of their campaigns.[Image for post]That’s all for today’s update! We look forward to building the future of knowledge sharing with the community.Click here to get paid for writing and peer reviewing articles!See also:-       Visit the Lunyr website-       Follow us on Twitter-       Join us on Reddit-       Join Lunyr-community on Discord-       Join us Telegram-       Check us out on Facebook-       Signup for the Lunyr newsletter-       Discuss on Bitcointalk.org Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the text say about the development releases?"

"Passage: Ms. Johnson, I remember watching your baby everyday while you and your husband went out to work. I remember having my red hair in a low ponytail.I remember me wearing white clothing on with my brown sandals. I remember everything up until now…And now we both have lost everything because of you.It was a beautiful Friday morning, no one was home except for myself and the baby. After cleaning up in the kitchen, I remember hearing a cough coming from the basement. My initial thought was to get the baby and leave but strangely enough I did not. However, I did continue with whatever needed to be done with the house. For the next few days, this has continued until I spoke with your husband. Yes, this may seem strange and very disrespectful but your husband had deep secrets. He told me that a close friend of his was staying over for awhile until he gets a new place. The guy name is Riley. He’s a yellow skinned man, with high cheekbones, black curly hair, with dark brown eyes. Also, he smoked these skinny, black cigarettes. Although I was skeptical at first, I still decided that it was okay.But as days passed, I felt as if there were more eyes on me than usual. Paranoia has stricken me while being in that house. Unfortunately, it did not stop me from sleeping when being there. It was a Saturday afternoon, the house was silent. While I was on the couch, my mind was telling me something. As if it it knew something bad was going to happen. But I brushed the idea off and drifted off into sleep.Two hours later… I jumped from my sleep and saw two men standing before me. They both were wearing all black and they were both prepared for whatever was to come. The man on my left, was running full force ahead of me. My immediate reaction was to kick him dead in the nuts, then pick up the vase that is sitting on the coffee table and knock it upside his head. Quickly enough, I took a piece of the broke vase and proceeded to stab him in the right eye with it. Slowly enough, took his eyeball out of his socket. That is when I noticed that the other guy disappeared. I only had a few seconds to get the baby and get up out of there.I sprinted up them stairs, ran into the baby’s bedroom. I grabbed his baby bag that is always prepared in case of emergency and the baby. Popped opened that window, stepped out onto the balcony and jumped.Luckily, we survived the jump and I was able to get up and run down the street. This run felt like eternity when in reality it was only two minutes that passed. One of my biggest regrets was looking back. Within a blink of an eye, a different man in all black tackled us onto the ground. The man on top of me and the baby had pinned us down to the ground. He turned around and signaled his men to come over. With that, I was able to raise my upper body up to see the baby. Although his eyes were closed he had this beautiful smile on him. “NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!” I quietly screamed out. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and laughed. I started to tear up because I really thought I lost him. Nevertheless, when something good happens there is always the worst to come. So, the man that chased us brought to this old 1970 black camaro. On the car it that had a bright orange spray paint mark on the passenger side door, and the car had these fresh rims. When first upon entering into the car, there was this light skinned, bald headed man who seemed to be his in late forties on the driver side of the seat. The only words he told me was, “buck up sweetheart it’s gonna be long a ride.”Thank you Mr. Johnson, for bringing misery to us. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the main source of conflict."	"There are the two men in the house, one of whom is the husband, and two men chasing the narrator. The narrator tries to save the baby and escapes, only to be caught by another man in the car."

Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize the point of this story, if there is one."	"The passage does not present a ""point"" or central thesis. ******The point of the story is that the narrator hates their partner and is lonely, but doesn't have the courage to leave them and so it's their own fault. ******This story is about a dislike of a person, their feelings of frustration and their blame of the other person for the situation they're in together. The point is that they dislike their relationship and they want the other person to change in order to make themselves better, but they realize they don't have the courage to leave their partner so it's their own fault that they feel lonely. ******The author seems to be frustrated with their partner for not functioning effectively in the morning and regrets having to spend their day with him/her. The author complains endlessly about their partner's faults and feels that their partner is useless, but they acknowledge that their loneliness is their own fault for not having the courage to leave them. ******The narrator is overcome by disdain for their partner, but they just wallow in it and don't do something about it. They recognize that their loneliness is their own fault."
"Passage: The fire glowed red, the windows glistened with snow on their britches. The large, ostentatious house stood tall over Seal Marsh. Ivy clung to the walls like butter to bread and chimneys stood as giants.       ‘’Damn, it feels good to be a gangster’’ Paigal said to himself as he stood on top of the mound overlooking Seal Marsh.   He glanced into the murky salt waters of what used to be the old town harbour. The town, now situated 2 miles East was once bustling with business and a new character passing through every day. It was the Grand Exchange in 2007 Varrock.    Paigal imagined the baker standing at his stall.  ‘’Get yer bread, get yer loaf ‘ere’’ he would shout and many a person would congregate around his flaky wooden bench. Paigal stood firm in the sand and whispered ‘’thanks Mr Skeletal’’. A terrible rumble occurred, yet Paigal was not suffering from hunger. The water rippled, the sand shook. Out from the dark depths of Seal Marsh arose a large skeletal figure, dressed in the finest suit of cashmere. He bore a top hat with a blood red ribbon around its base.   His face lifted.  ‘’You require my assistance’’ it shrieked. Eyes of emptiness sat upon his face, dark caves in place of eye balls. A once fancy bowtie hung from his neck as if it were a length of ivy.   ‘’Y..Yes sir’’ Paigal squeaked. ‘’I need to go back in time and stop something terrible’’  ‘’Mr Skeletal is not pleased with this awakening’’ he muttered in his deep, gravelly voice.  Paigal turned to enter Gifford House, he paced forward towards the door. Just as his clammy hand grasped the knob, Mr Skeletal reached forward with his titanic arm and hit Paigal with a set of jumper cables.  ‘’Mortal, I will do your bidding, but first tell me why you must go back. What awaits you in 2001?’’ Mr Skeletal exclaimed in a booming voice.  Paigal wondered how the skeleton knew he was going back to 2001, but still gave the information willingly.  ‘’I..I need to go back….you have picked me out. You have decided to help. The distant shot of a building burning is engrained in my mind. The white cotton shirt twirling, turning, small in the clouds but waving, waving. I need to stop 9/11 Mr Skeletal.’’ Paigal released anxiously.  Mr Skeletal looked shocked. He leant back and thought for a moment. His brain working was audible for miles.    ‘’Very Well then’’ he said. ‘’But be warned, the results may shock you’’  A bright light filled the sky like a basin. A crack of thunder shook Seal Marsh and the water twisted and turned in to a skyscraper. The wind picked up, a howling roar arrived as Mr Skeletal raised his bony arms above his infamous top hat. The sound was deafening, causing Paigal to collapse to his knees in agony, his eyes clamped shut. A silent tear dribbled down his cheek and into the vortex that now surrounded him.  The thunder clapped.  Everything was calm.  Paigal opened his eyes and to his surprise he was no longer surrounded by the dank waters of Seal Marsh, his knees no longer covered in grey sand. Instead he appeared to be in a jungle except it was nothing to the likes of which he had witnessed before. People rushed around him, suits and dresses, yellow and black cars wizzed past.   He had arrived.  Paigal searched for the towers, the ones he needed. High and low, his eyes glistened with the reflection of the World Trade Centre.    He had found them. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about the gang that Paigal belongs to?"	"No answer."

Paigal is able to find the World Trade Center."
"Passage: The rules were simple, but the game itself impacts a lot thought. I have played this game with lots of people. I remember my first time. I told him, ‘here are the cards. There are five of them.’The idea of the game is to have a card with a high number, but as you turn over a new card, you must discard the previous one. I tell him that every time I’ve showed someone else this game, they mostly make the same mistakes. I turn over the first card and reveal the very first number: [76]. When I first played even I thought, ‘is it out of a hundred?’ If it were out of a hundred, everyone would stick with the first card. But what if it were out of a thousand, or a million? It’s the uncertainty that makes people pick a second card. If they stuck with just seventy-six, and found out that the next card was in the thousands, they’d kick themselves.Pete asked, “another card please?” Perhaps it was my long hair, but he wasn’t paying attention to me when I boldly said that almost everyone makes the same mistakes. The next card shows: [32]. The second card is about half the first value, but just below. People still think that it could possibly be out of a much larger number, and no matter what, thirty-two appears to be a scam. Without much delay, “another.”I like to think that these cards represent opportunities in life. No one wants to look like a fool and stick with something when they don’t know its relative value. You’re offered five cards in this game, and they could hold any number, why stick with the first one? The next card reveals the number: [1]. “What? That’s horrible, I got the lowest number!” With two cards left, Pete’s next choice was predictable.People are given first opportunities in many aspects of life. Whether it’s a job or love, people always wonder if there’s a better one out there. With no ability to compare, we are unable to decide if something is worth committing to. When Pete drew the number one, he felt bad for not sticking with either of the first two cards.

"Passage: The rules were simple, but the game itself impacts a lot thought. I have played this game with lots of people. I remember my first time. I told him, ‘here are the cards. There are five of them.’The idea of the game is to have a card with a high number, but as you turn over a new card, you must discard the previous one. I tell him that every time I’ve showed someone else this game, they mostly make the same mistakes. I turn over the first card and reveal the very first number: [76]. When I first played even I thought, ‘is it out of a hundred?’ If it were out of a hundred, everyone would stick with the first card. But what if it were out of a thousand, or a million?

If they stuck with just seventy-six, and found out that the next card was in the thousands, they’d kick themselves.Pete asked, “another card please?” Perhaps it was my long hair, but he wasn’t paying attention to me when I boldly said that almost everyone makes the same mistakes.

People still think that it could possibly be out of a much larger number, and no matter what, thirty-two appears to be a scam.

"Passage: The Sunspider crawls along my arm, its gem-body focusing the sun, leaving a tingling pain and barely burned line in my skin. It backs along, licking up the cooked flesh. It doesn't bother me, but I know it once made the others squeamish. I've grown used to it, and I love that I am contributing to the next generation of partners in my world. At the end of the hot months, I will spy them among the early ice crystals and know I am part of them. I move my arm down to the sand to allow this little mother to move on, and walk through past the small rock outcrop.Away from the rocks, the sun seems harsher, and I squint from the pain it brings my eyes. The summer months are still to come; the spring is short. I must find a quiet place to sleep again.As I move across the dried salt plains, I shield my eyes with my robe and look out to the horizon. The next set of rocky hills are distant. When I sleep so long, all changes. Mountains rise, though the oceans are long gone. For so long here it has been just the Sunspiders and I...I sleep my seasons, awake to greet them, and walk ahead to find the next tomb, hoping I am not the only and the last doing so. The thousands-of-days winter has led to my travelling springtime. I sleep during the blackness and cold, then again during the fiery long summers as it bakes the world. The short spring and autumn are wonderful to me as I rise again to walk.The days are brilliant, and each step forward is a memory so many before. The tap of my feet in the dust echoes the past. The nights are my calm rest, as I stare at the stars. I remember clouds. When they existed, I ignored them except as they prevented me from seeing into the distances. I know all things move, even those stars, but I'm not able to visualize the changes that have happened since my youth, though it's been so long that they must have.I'm not sure what to expect. I spend all these times thinking that this will be the moment when I see something left behind from when I was not alone. Yet I know that with each sleep and each cycle around the sun the chance of spotting a connection to history lessens. Apparently I am the only thing made to last forever, as even the decaying foundations of our previous civilization fade away into oddly-coloured dust, and then disappear entirely in the winds.I don't count the days walking toward my goal. I note that it gets hotter as I move along. The spring seems shorter each time, and I wonder if next time I will remember to keep track.And then I am at the bottom of the outcropping. I stare up, the sun behind me, looking for glints and squared shadows that might be some sign. I am not disappointed when I don't find what I did not expect to see. The next morning I climb, and move sideways around the rocks, stopping frequently to stare again. Nothing.I climb, and seek the caves, cracks and shadows...seeking a safe place to retire. Each small shadow is a relief from the sun, but not accommodating to my form. With practised effort, I pull myself up on a ledge and stop, as everything inside me screams. From deep within me, I yell and shriek, while standing utterly motionless.A line! A depth! The remains of an old fire! A scrap of metal! My eyes are on fire, pupils opened as wide as they can, taking this simple but incredible view deep inside me! I clutch at my sides and shake. I cannot move forward. I cannot risk this being a mirage.I turn away, overwhelmed with everything...and fall. With shock I don't scramble to find hold in the empty air. I watched what I have sought for so long disappearing away from me in the distance, like it were falling away from me, and the whole world shifting in my view.I think I remember bouncing. I don't remember coming to a stop between two jagged boulders. I am broken, flesh torn and whatever has been keeping me going all this time falling apart and falling out. It's early morning and I am looking up toward the sun. Its heat shines at my eyes and I watch where I hope shadows begin to appear. A fire glints above me. A Sunspider, an identical diamond to the ones I have known. Not quite alive, and not dead. Much like me.Another, and another...and soon hundreds. A thousand Sunspiders above me, their scattered light twinkling on everything around me. I cannot move, but I watched. I could not begin to count them above me, as they crawl over each other, refracting each others light, sending it in all directions. The are joining, separating, and spreading across the gap above me, creating a glowing shield. It's like nothing I have seen before, and I nearly forget my state. As they lock together and slow their frenzied actions, I seem them adjust, like a ripple on a pond, and I am struck that I still remember water. They are focusing that light, and that sun. Together, like a giant lens, and I know they are part of me from all the times I've taken care of them. A shudder, and I know. They are finishing things. With that much power together, they are taking care of me. A funeral pyre. I think I smile, as they put an end to my journey. I'll become the dust in the winds and still keep travelling this world.

I note that it gets hotter as I move along. The spring seems shorter each time, and I wonder if next time I will remember to keep track.And then I am at the bottom of the outcropping. I stare up, the sun behind me, looking for glints and squared shadows that might be some sign. I am not disappointed when I don't find what I did not expect to see. The next morning I climb, and move sideways around the rocks, stopping frequently to stare again. Nothing.I climb, and seek the caves, cracks and shadows...seeking a safe place to retire. Each small shadow is a relief from the sun, but not accommodating to my form. With practised effort, I pull myself up on a ledge and stop, as everything inside me screams. From deep within me, I yell and shriek, while standing utterly motionless.A line! A depth! The remains of an old fire! A scrap of metal! My eyes are on fire, pupils opened as wide as they can, taking this simple but incredible view deep inside me! I clutch at my sides and shake. I cannot move forward. I cannot risk this being a mirage.I turn away, overwhelmed with everything...and fall. With shock I don't scramble to find hold in the empty air. I watched what I have sought for so long disappearing away from me in the distance, like it were falling away from me, and the whole world shifting in my view.I think I remember bouncing. I don't remember coming to a stop between two jagged boulders. I am broken, flesh torn and whatever has been keeping me going all this time falling apart and falling out. It's early morning and I am looking up toward the sun. Its heat shines at my eyes and I watch where I hope shadows begin to appear. A fire glints above me. A Sunspider, an identical diamond to the ones I have known. Not quite alive, and not dead. Much like me.Another, and another...and soon hundreds. A thousand Sunspiders above me, their scattered light twinkling on everything around me. I cannot move, but I watched. I could not begin to count them above me, as they crawl over each other, refracting each others light, sending it in all directions. The are joining, separating, and spreading across the gap above me, creating a glowing shield. It's like nothing I have seen before, and I nearly forget my state. As they lock together and slow their frenzied actions, I seem them adjust, like a ripple on a pond, and I am struck that I still remember water. They are focusing that light, and that sun. Together, like a giant lens, and I know they are part of me from all the times I've taken care of them. A shudder, and I know. They are finishing things. With that much power together, they are taking care of me. A funeral pyre. I think I smile, as they put an end to my journey. I'll become the dust in the winds and still keep travelling this world. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize what this story says about seeing."	"No answer."
"Passage: The Sunspider crawls along my arm, its gem-body focusing the sun, leaving a tingling pain and barely burned line in my skin. It backs along, licking up the cooked flesh. It doesn't bother me, but I know it once made the others squeamish. I've grown used to it, and I love that I am contributing to the next generation of partners in my world. At the end of the hot months, I will spy them among the early ice crystals and know I am part of them. I move my arm down to the sand to allow this little mother to move on, and walk through past the small rock outcrop.Away from the rocks, the sun seems harsher, and I squint from the pain it brings my eyes. The summer months are still to come; the spring is short. I must find a quiet place to sleep again.As I move across the dried salt plains, I shield my eyes with my robe and look out to the horizon. The next set of rocky hills are distant. When I sleep so long, all changes. Mountains rise, though the oceans are long gone. For so long here it has been just the Sunspiders and I...I sleep my seasons, awake to greet them, and walk ahead to find the next tomb, hoping I am not the only and the last doing so. The thousands-of-days winter has led to my travelling springtime. I sleep during the blackness and cold, then again during the fiery long summers as it bakes the world. The short spring and autumn are wonderful to me as I rise again to walk.The days are brilliant, and each step forward is a memory so many before. The tap of my feet in the dust echoes the past. The nights are my calm rest, as I stare at the stars. I remember clouds. When they existed, I ignored them except as they prevented me from seeing into the distances. I know all things move, even those stars, but I'm not able to visualize the changes that have happened since my youth, though it's been so long that they must have.I'm not sure what to expect. I spend all these times thinking that this will be the moment when I see something left behind from when I was not alone. Yet I know that with each sleep and each cycle around the sun the chance of spotting a connection to history lessens. Apparently I am the only thing made to last forever, as even the decaying foundations of our previous civilization fade away into oddly-coloured dust, and then disappear entirely in the winds.I don't count the days walking toward my goal.

Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Describe the turning point in the story."	"The turning point in the story is when the narrator finds a scrap of metal. This is the first time the narrator has found something from ancient times when they weren't alone. The narrator is overwhelmed with emotion and falls."
"Passage: Two Houses.Picture two houses across the street from one another. They looked perfectly normal and sturdy on the outside, but on the inside they were run down and falling apart. Inside of one lived a quiet and peaceful man, and in the other lived a beautiful and cheerful woman. Neither of them, however, liked being outside the confines of their own house.One day, the peaceful man ventured across the street to the other house and was invited inside. The two strangers visited, shared laughs, told stories, and enjoyed the others company. At the end of the day, the man returned to his house.The next day he visited again, but instead of talking, he started to slowly repair the inside of the run down house. When one of his repairs would break, he would immediately come over to fix the damage with a smile on his face. The two housekeepers became used to seeing one another each day, and eventually, the woman would come over to the man's house to visit. The woman noticed that his house looked much worse on the inside than hers, and started to sneak inside at night while he was asleep to make repairs. When the man would try to fix something himself, or repair damages to his own house, he would fail, and sometimes even make things worse. But the next morning,  he would notice that things would be fixed. This puzzled the man and he decided to ask the woman about it the next time she came over.The next evening they spent together, he asked and she informed the man of what she had been doing, and the man asked why. She replied,""Because people who show a caring and wholesome heart deserve to receive the same treatment they give to others."" The man became confused.          ""But I am a shut in. Nobody gives to me, and I don't give to them. Why does somebody like me deserve somebody as wonderful as you?""The woman put her hand on the man's shoulder and looked into his dark brown eyes. She noticed a hurt that had always seemed to hide beneath his smile, a sorrow that hadn't been revealed in a very long time. She said in a soft and gentle voice: ""Somebody that prefers to be alone does not always prefer being lonely. There is always somebody who will care.""The two embraced, and the man sobbed and became limp in the woman's arms. Once he had calmed down, the woman kissed him on the cheek and returned to her house without saying a word.The following morning, he noticed another man performing landscaping on her lawn, painting the outside of her house, and cleaning her patio. Each day the house would look more and more beautiful. He became sad that the woman had found somebody else to do her work, and started to loathe the landscaper that would beautify her house all the time.The woman remained indoors all day, trying to make the interior of her house look as pleasant as the exterior. However, most of her attempts at repairs or renovation were disasters. The person she hired was no help, and was only after her money. She began to miss her neighbors company, along with his sturdy repairs and his gentle smile. As days went by, the man and woman thought about each other more and more, but never saw each other.One afternoon, the woman heard her doorbell ring. Knowing it wasn't the landscaper she hired, she curiously approached the peephole of the door. Seeing that nobody was outside, she opened the door and looked for pranksters. Looking down, she saw a small, dirty looking tin with a bow neatly placed on top of it.The interior of the unkempt tin was extravagantly decorated with soft velvet from top to bottom, and in the center laid a simple necklace with a key on it, resting on top of a small note. Putting the necklace on, she unfolded the small note and noticed little droplets of water on the page.""You are the only one that can make it feel less empty. Please take care of it for me while I'm gone. I must go, but I will return one day.""After reading it the woman dropped to her knees, and tears started to form in her tightly shut eyes. For what seemed like years, she spent the next few months wishing the man would come back and going into his house to take care of it while he was gone. She noticed that every little thing she had done to the house remained unchanged, as if he never tried to correct the small mistakes she had made.Eventually, the man returned. The woman was thrilled and filled with happiness, but also saddened by the fact that the man no longer came across the street to visit her. A few days after his return, she noticed he was packing his belongings into boxes. Fearing that he might move away, the woman mustered up the courage to go talk to the man.""Why are you putting everything into boxes?"" The woman asked.    ""Because,"" the man replied solemnly, ""I am looking to create new memories and find a fresh start."" The woman said nothing and returned to her house, slamming the door and fighting back tears.The next morning, the man was loading his belongings into a moving truck when he saw a pile of boxes bigger than his own sitting in the woman's lawn. He walked across the street to the pile, and saw a note taped to one of the boxes.""I will always love you, and I promise that I will always be next to you. No matter where we go.""The man's face turned into a broad smile, and he looked up to see the woman on her front patio, looking right back at him, the necklace glistening in the sunlight. She ran into his arms and they kissed for what felt like an eternity. The pair continued to load all of their belongings into the one moving truck, and left that very evening. Holding hands with his true love, the man looked into the rear view mirror to see the sun setting on the old, abandoned houses for the last time, and felt what was truly a pure happiness. An odd and relieving sensation washed over him like a tide, as he realized that he would never have to search for anything in his life, as long as he lived. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize what the story has to say about loneliness."	"Loneliness can be overcome. If a person prefers to be alone, they may feel lonely. There are people in this world that will care, but they need to be found. The man was lonely because he was a shut-in."

It was the last single to be released prior to the album's release.On 7 August, several teases were made on Coldrain's social media accounts with a photo of lead singer, Masato Hayakawa, surrounded by darkness, as well as a translucent image of him in the same photo which is contrasted by a flame and water.

"Passage: Once, we were brothers.Once, almost seems like a whole life ago, I stood by him and we fought and we bled and we *killed* together.We were part of 5th Company, deployed to Ukraine during the escalation of the Crimean Conflict, a war which would later take more lives than Iraq and destroy more infrastructure than the Great War. We fought together in a conflict that, one day, only we would understand. And no politician could fathom what we saw there, no civilian could've known how we bled.We shared bullets, bottles, and blood - when we were brothers. We were stationed with Alpha Squad. We led all the missions, he and I. I was sergeant; he was corporal. All the men in that squad were our brothers, and we were theirs. I can still remember a time when I would've taken a bat to the head for any of those guys.Now, I stand before him, and we are no longer brothers.Somehow, the politics ate him. Probably ate me, too, he'd say. But now I'm sitting in an airport in Crimea and he has a gun to my head. And if anyone bothered to look up they wouldn't have thought for a moment that we were brothers.But we were. Once.Now he's a nationalist. Defected after the war, and found Russia to be his home, his country. I stayed with the US, and all he could say to me was how blind I'd become. After all we'd been through, as brothers, he couldn't believe I'd still take their side.But I didn't. I just want my pension. I just want to go home. So does Alpha Squad. They're sitting next to me, but their eyes are far away. I don't bother to call to them. This isn't their business.I look up at him. The barrel is staring down my face. He's smiling.""Once, we were brothers,"" he said.""Still are,"" I replied, ""Only we've seen what you've seen.""""No,"" he lowers the pistol, ""No, that's not it at all. You viewed what I did, but you didn't see. None of you did. Or you'd be on my side.""""I'm on no one's side. I just want to go home,"" my voice wavers, ""I'm tired. I miss my family.""""We're your family,"" he raises the pistol again, ""None of those fucks at home knows what happened here.""""Maybe it's better they don't know,"" I turn away, toward the rest of the squad. They're all busy in their own little worlds.The engineer specialist has a happy little grin on his face. He's remembering that time we saved those two kids after we accidentally killed their parents while we were clearing out an apartment complex. Those two kids later got blown up by a landmine. But he's not remembering that.Our sniper and spotter are talking, hushed, about what they'll do when they get home. I heard they might get married and move to South America. They want to forget what happened here. I know they never will.The new guy is sitting, chattering his teeth. He never got used to combat, because he deployed a week before our squad was relieved from duty - two weeks before the war ended. He still has the nighttime chills from killing. He's grasping a folder in his hand - for his psychologist, when he's back stateside.The airport is filled with people: refugees fleeing the war zone, servicemen and women going home, and children waiting for parents. No one notices us two.""They're right. You're just a soldier,"" he puts the pistol away, ""You don't get the bigger picture. But that's okay. Some of you aren't meant to. I'll see you boys stateside - in one piece or in a casket."" ""You're not gonna shoot me?"" I ask.""No, because we were brothers,"" he replied. He disappears into the crowd. I look down at my dog tags. No one will remember what we did here. The hippies will cuss us out; the families will avoid us; the government will ignore us.But we'll have each other. Because, once, we were brothers. And once is enough.  Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the story say about brotherhood?"	"The narrator and the corporal are in Alpha squad. They are as close as brothers and share a bond so close that the narrator is willing to take a bullet for him.

"Passage: 7:00pm EST&amp;#x200B;Good evening, America.&amp;#x200B;I know the media has been climbing all over each other for a statement from the Presidential office regarding our current health crisis, but I wanted to have as much information as possible before addressing the American people. Were times not so dire and the need for action so immediate, I would still be waiting for more information to address the nation. Unfortunately, America, that is not the case. The bald truth is this: more is unknown about this epidemic than is known. Medical professionals around the world are working tirelessly to provide answers, but as of right now, no cure or preventative mediation have shown long-term effectiveness. &amp;#x200B;Known by different names around the country – Creeping Flu, Bellows, Influenza M – the infection is spread through direct disease transmission. Simply being touched by an infected person does not cause transmission of the disease from one person to another, but an exchange of bodily fluids will. This can come from being bitten by an infected person, ingesting fluids from an infected person, or sexual contact with an infected person. I must stress… simply touching an infected person will not transmit the disease. Forced quarantine upon medical professionals based on this misinformation will only lead to further infection and unnecessary condemnation, not to mention the loss of valuable personnel.&amp;#x200B;The speed of infection appears to increase with every new generation. Because of this, providing an accurate timeline for symptom progression is impossible. What we can do is provide a concrete, concise list of symptoms. Before we address this, however, it is important to note that one or two symptoms does not necessarily indicate infection. With so much confusion, stress, and exposure to new drugs, it absolutely makes sense that people would be getting sick with perfectly normal diseases. This is not the Wild West and we are not horses: a bullet is not the cure for a broken leg, nor is it the cure for the average flu. Even now, when the infection can potentially spread so quickly throughout the body, we must be sure of our decisions. &amp;#x200B;That being said, the symptoms, in order, are as follows:&amp;#x200B;1. General fatigue/weakness2. Cluster headaches: sharp, burning pain behind the left eye3. Burst blood vessels in left eye4. Quickly onset fever of above 106 degrees Fahrenheit5. Vomiting/diarrhea6. Hallucinations7. Paralysis8. Death9. Reanimation&amp;#x200B;Symptoms will appear in the order shown. No variation of symptom order has been observed, though personal susceptibility to individual symptoms may accelerate the onset of specific steps. Again, I must stress that individual symptoms do not indicate an overall infection. &amp;#x200B;Finally, it is with a heavy heart I inform America that its military will be unable to assist at this time. Were this an invading foreign power at our nations door, the United States Armed Forces would be fully prepared to stand and defend her people. As it is, we have been found shamefully unprepared to address an epidemic of this strength and nature. For the foreseeable future, the American people will need to rely on their own grit and perseverance in order to weather this storm. This will not be the first time the mettle of the American people was tested, nor will it be the second, nor the third. America is a nation born of independence and ingenuity. A nation of adaptation and spirit. This is a fight we will win, my fellow Americans, but one that will take a heavy toll.&amp;#x200B;Doubt is a rot in the heart of mankind which is easily planted by fear – one that must not be allowed to take root.&amp;#x200B;It has been an honor serving you, America. Thank you, good luck, and god speed. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What elements reflect the story's genre?"	"The story is a speech given by the President of the United States to the American people regarding the national health crisis."
"Passage: “Dear friends and colleagues, I know, that you know, that we all know, that the main attraction of this symposium is to brag about our greatest and weirdest nutjobs. We’ve all heard Dr. Johnson talk about this woman, who believed she was a glass of jam, over a coffee, or Prof. Miller explain how a suicidal man couldn’t hang himself because his extreme fear of height.”  Some people in the room started laughing, while most just nodded in agreement. Some murmuring came up around Johnson and Miller, and as soon as everything went silent again, the man at the stand continued.“This place here in front of all of you is usually reserved for someone talking about new developments in diagnostics and therapies. But in my case, the patient himself was so intertwined with the disease, that I can’t get around him.”  Dramatic pause  “Please meet mister Theo Bog!”As soon as these words were said, a picture was projected on the giant screen behind the presenter. it was a portrait shot of a man in his mid-forties. A long beard, fuzzy hair, thick eyebrows and an awkward smile looked aimlessly into the audience. Even though his eyes were dampened, maybe because of a cataract, it felt as if they had seen a lot and had a shine of knowledge.“This man came to me by himself. He didn’t have any money, nor an insurance. He claimed, that he needed help, because he would soon fall back into his old god complex. When I asked him, why he couldn’t go back to his old therapist, he told me that it was because Ernest Jones was dead.”Unruly whispers arose among the doctors and professors.“As most of you certainly know, Mr. Jones was a good friend of Sigmund Freud and one of the first practitioners of psychoanalysis. As such he was active until a few months before his death in 1958.  Theo Bog, a man who is 35 years old in the year 2017, claims to have been cured of a god complex by it’s inventor, who has long since been dead.Of course it isn’t that unusual for somebody to believe to be a historically important figure or to just believe to have met with someone who has been dead for a long time. And during our sessions he told me about his therapy.  He explained me, how he had thought to have been god, and how mister Jones helped him by argumentatively disproving such a higher, all-knowing being. The problem was, that he started to forget these arguments and as such started to fall back into believing to be god.The first thing I tried, was to make clear that he couldn’t have met with Mr. Jones. But this turned out to be impossible, as Bog obviously had done thorough research. He knew a lot of odds and quirks about his first therapist. I even let him meet with an old Student of Jones, but this was only counterproductive, as they ended up agreeing that they both had known the same man.”What followed could best be described as a giant collective facepalm. The reasons behind it were different though. Some thought, that this unexpected outcome was a worst case, rendering poor Theo unstoppable in his belief, while others were shocked that somebody would let a psychologically critical case meet up with a former student who must be in his 90ies by now.One man in the audience stood up. It was Dr. Johnson. He made eye contact with the man at the microphone and, as soon as the room was calm enough for him to speak, he asked a question: “Dr. Parthrow, you yourself implied before, that you’re here to tell us about a new development. Would you please come to the point?”A aly grin hushed over the presenters face, then he continued: “Of course, of course. Now that I’ve presented you with my case, I’ll show you the solution I’ve found. I’m particularly proud of it because of its simplicity.  I went online. I searched for a polite, atheistic community, and signed him up there. It’s absolutely amazing, how easily people can be swayed. It took Theo two days to go back to a normal life, and one month later he already had a job.What do we learn from this? Sometimes absurd and weird ways solutions are really easy. While I don’t know if the same therapy would have worked with any other patient, I’m confident, that this story will help you find new ways to cure illnesses. With this I’m finished. Are there any questions?”- Several years later a young and dynamic Theo left the office building. He looked like thirty now, though he knew that he was about ten years older. Thanks to the internet actually, he knew everything. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Who is Theo Bog?"	"Theo Bog is the patient the doctor is addressing in the story. He's a man in his forties, seeking help for his god complex. His previous therapist is Ernest Jones, a man who died in 1958, and he is unavailable. (The year is 2017 in the story.) The narrator, a therapist, tries to dissuade Mr. Bog that he didn't actually meet Jones and fails. Bog claims that Jones' arguments disproving the existence of God cured him in the past, but he's forgetting, and his god complex is coming back. The narrator finds a friendly atheistic group online for him, and Theo Bog is cured quickly and permanently."

"Passage: ..\For the third time that week, Will woke up to screaming kids. Swearing, he looked over for his wife of fifteen years but noticed she was missing, in fact he had not seen her since last night. He put the thought behind him as he swung his legs over the bed and scratched his morning stubble. He got up after a few minutes and half stumbled half walked over to the bathroom. As he grabbed for his razor, he heard a sharp snapping sound and swore once more, then lumbered down stairs. .         He hit the bottom step just as the door opened and his wife, who he was not entirely pleased to see entered, ""Look who decided to show up."" He mumbled, and staring at his feet he shuffled towards the broken lamp and his two youngest children. She retorted back but he pretended not to hear it, he started back up the stairs with his kids...         ""YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL YOU HEARD ME AND YO---"", she stopped as a chair broke against the wall, sending splinters in every direction. Will just glared at her and thought about what a wreck she had become, in her hayday she was quite the looker but fifteen years of marriage had taken its toll. Will was always mild tempered, he cursed but ofcourse everyone around here did, and he was never violent, but the last year of her walking in at daybreak and dealing with a four and six year old had changed him, he was still level headed though, so he walked up the stairs, grabbed some clothes, his wallet, his phone, and his keys, then left to a dumbstruck wife, and two crying children. ..          Will reached for his phone to dail up his old friend Terrance, he was a charter captian and Will could think of no better escape then some open sea. He decided to call in sick to work first, to groans from his boss. After 3 rings Terrance picked up and agreed to take him out, he drove out the five miles it took to get to the old wooden dock. He walked along the side, avoiding the numerous cracks, and got to Terrance's boat. They silently greeted and started prepping, and soon enough they were off. .         After an hour of relaxing silence Will heard a shout that made him go from sleeping to wide awake in no time, he ran to the captains quaters and saw Terrance slumped over in his seat, he checked his pulse and felt nothing. Will killed the engine and just sat there, staring as the sun lightened the sea, while his friend was slumped confortably in death beside him. Eventually Will slumped against the wall, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and fell asleep. .         Will jolted awake, feeling he just awoke from the worst nightmare ever, he reached over and put his hand on his wife, except she was cold, so cold. Will jumped up and stared at Terrance with horrorfying realization. He walked back up to the deck and looked at the night sky, it hit him that his kids and wife would be worrying about him. He snorted. Might be worrying about him was more like it. Still, he did miss them, which was surprising. He sat on the side of the boat and started dozing off..         He was sitting on a chair in his living room with his family, but his wife was younger, he looked around doubtfully for his two kids, and only found them when he looked under the table. They were joyfully pushing his chair back, laughing and smiling. Will started laughing too, it was contagious and soon his wife joined it. ""I love you guys."" As his chair tipped too far and he fell backwards through his floor and into the dark.

"After fifteen years of marriage, Will and his wife have a rather unpleasant relationship. Ever since his wife would show up at daybreak in a very fit of temper, his wife has changed for the worse. Will's wife has become a wreck and she certainly lost her good looks over the years, which Will notices. Will is usually quite mild tempered, but the last year clearly changed him. He was never violent and remains a very level headed man, however, he did walk away from his wife and two children. "

Whenever something needs to be done I see him doing it. He doesn’t just sit around; I’ve actually seen him go into the mines. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m a child but not even the adults in the village are as active as him.       He’s always leaving the kingdom and coming back with tons of different things. I can’t always see what he’s coming back with, but I’ve seen bones, some kind of meat that just looks bad, and even strange looking pearls. And the dogs! He has so many dogs that there’s not a single wild dog here. He must be traveling great distances to find all these dogs, because I know they’re not from here. When I see him doing all these strange things I start asking my parents what it is he’s doing, and they tell me: “don’t question the king,” but they never tell me why. He doesn’t look old, so he can’t be all that wise. All that work he does and all the times he leaves - it’s not normal.  I was  sick of wondering.I finally got into his castle and he was at his workbench. When I got closer he looked back at me, seemingly confused, but he turned back around and kept tinkering with some weird red dust. I got closer and mustered up the courage to ask him as politely as I could, “How come you’re so different than everyone else?” The king stopped, stood up and looked at me. He asked, “Excuse me?” and I said it again. He chuckled briefly under his breath and said “it seems like you’re different too.”       He started to tell me a story. “When I was your age, I lived in a different kingdom and I felt the same way about my king. I would go to school and all the kids and the teachers would seem to just drift through their lives, but not the king; he was always spontaneous. I was finally sick of that curious feeling, so I went and talked to my king and he told me his story. Sometime afterwards the kingdom was destroyed and all the people inside were attacked by monsters. It was terrible. There were explosions, arrows, and the groans of the undead. I was able to escape, but barely. I fought my way out with nothing but my hands. finally I found a break in the chaos and I found a cave and covered the entrance with dirt. I was devastated, but I wanted to live so I built a shelter.  I enjoyed building. Then since I had built my shelter I began mining - I enjoyed that as well. I had so many supplies I decided to build more and I ended up building a village. Strangely enough people appeared. That village moved on to become this kingdom. That’s my story.”I asked him why he told me all that. and he told me simply because I was a player. A player? I was so confused. He then told me that only players are kings. I didn’t understand. He went on by asking me what my earliest memory is and I told him standing outside. “Exactly,” He said. “That was the first time you entered this world.” He started talking about how this life isn’t real and that once he’s gone he’ll be able to enter the real world again.He began taking me adventuring with him, that’s when he would explain things and share his knowledge with me. “When a king dies, everything he ever did goes with him. That’s how my king’s old kingdom was destroyed. I left my Kingdom and made a village. I have people of my own now. My king was killed by a mob of three suicide creatures right outside his gate.

The Australian government tipped off the FBI to what Papadapoulos had said, according to the Times.Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with special counsel Mueller’s investigation.Still, the revelation that Strzok, who sent text messages disparaging Trump, launched the original investigation into the Trump campaign will further fuel debate over political bias at the FBI.Strzok and Lisa Page, who is a lawyer at the FBI, exchanged private text messages during the campaign that were disparaging of Trump. Strzok and Page, who were having an affair, were both on Mueller’s special counsel team at one point before being reassigned last yearStrzok was also a central figure in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email arrangement. Republicans, citing text messages between Strzok and Lisa Page, have said the FBI determined ahead of time to give Clinton an election year pass. The memo released by Republicans on Friday, which was authored by staffers for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes[]Devin Gerald NunesBiden's Cabinet a battleground for future GOP White House hopefuls Overnight Defense: Trump loyalist to lead Pentagon transition | Democrats ask VA for vaccine distribution plan | Biden to get classified intel reports Ex-Nunes aide linked to Biden conspiracy theories will lead Pentagon transition MORE (R-Calif.), also criticizes the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier in a warrant application.After the counterintelligence investigation began, the memo states, the FBI used the Steele dossier, in part, to obtain surveillance warrants for Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who is not related to Lisa Page.Then-FBI Director James Comey[]James Brien ComeyTrump's self-pardon would clash with his impeachment The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Mastercard - Dem leaders back smaller COVID-19 relief bill as pandemic escalates Trump blasts special counsel Durham for moving too slowly MORE sought and received a warrant to spy on Carter Page in October 2016, the document states.The surveillance applications typically involve several layers of authentication.

"Passage: _INTRODUCTION TO CIRCLE PACKING: THE THEORY OF DISCRETE ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS_ is a mathematical monograph concerning systems of tangent circles and the circle packing theorem. It was written by Kenneth Stephenson and published in 2005 by the Cambridge University Press.TopicsCircle packings, as studied in this book, are systems of circles that touch at tangent points but do not overlap, according to a combinatorial pattern of adjacencies specifying which pairs of circles should touch. The circle packing theorem states that a circle packing exists if and only if the pattern of adjacencies forms a planar graph; it was originally proved by Paul Koebe in the 1930s, and popularized by William Thurston, who rediscovered it in the 1970s and connected it with the theory of conformal maps and conformal geometry. As a topic, this should be distinguished from sphere packing, which considers higher dimensions (here, everything is two dimensional) and is more focused on packing density than on combinatorial patterns of tangency.The book is divided into four parts, in progressive levels of difficulty. The first part introduces the subject visually, encouraging the reader to think about packings not just as static objects but as dynamic systems of circles that change in predictable ways when the conditions under which they are formed (their patterns of adjacency) change. The second part concerns the proof of the circle packing theorem itself, and of the associated rigidity theorem: every maximal planar graph can be associated with a circle packing that is unique up to Möbius transformations of the plane. More generally the same result holds for any triangulated manifold, with a circle packing on a topologically equivalent Riemann surface that is unique up to conformal equivalence.The third part of the book concerns the degrees of freedom that arise when the pattern of adjacencies is not fully triangulated (it is a planar graph, but not a maximal planar graph). In this case, different extensions of this pattern to larger maximal planar graphs will lead to different packings, which can be mapped to each other by corresponding circles. The book explores the connection between these mappings, which it calls discrete analytic functions, and the analytic functions of classical mathematical analysis. The final part of the book concerns a conjecture of William Thurston, proved by Burton Rodin and Dennis Sullivan, that makes this analogy concrete: conformal mappings from any topological disk to a circle can be approximated by filling the disk by a hexagonal packing of unit circles, finding a circle packing that adds to that pattern of adjacencies a single outer circle, and constructing the resulting discrete analytic function. This part also includes applications to number theory and the visualization of brain structure.Stephenson has implemented algorithms for circle packing and used them to construct the many illustrations of the book, giving to much of this work the flavor of experimental mathematics, although it is also mathematically rigorous. Unsolved problems are listed throughout the book, which also includes nine appendices on related topics such as the ring lemma and Doyle spirals.Audience and receptionThe book presents research-level mathematics, and is aimed at professional mathematicians interested in this and related topics. Reviewer Frédéric Mathéus describes the level of the material in the book as “both mathematically rigorous and accessible to the novice mathematician”, presented in an approachable style that conveys the author's love of the material. However, although the preface to the book states that no background knowledge is necessary, and that the book can be read by non-mathematicians or used as an undergraduate textbook, reviewer Michele Intermont disagrees, noting that it has no exercises for students and writing that “non-mathematicians will be nothing other than frustrated with this book”. Similarly, reviewer David Mumford finds the first seven chapters (part I and much of part II) to be at an undergraduate level, but writes that “as a whole, the book is suitable for graduate students in math”. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:What does the article say about circular logic?"	"The article does not say anything about circular logic."
"Passage: Today I have to wake up with you again. Mornings with you are worse than evenings because at least at night tomorrow is closer, and I have to spend today with you. I get tired of waking up with you, so I stopped sleeping as much.i think we should shave it has been a whileWe definitely should. For once, I agree with you. You look hideous.i knowThe shower is further away than I thought. It appears we're going to have to get up. We have to be somewhere in less than 3 hours, so if you would hurry we might make it. it is cold and hard to moveWhiner. Excuses. It's already been an hour and if you don't hurry up, we'll never make it there. Why won't you move? It's already been two hours and if you don't hurry up, we'll never make it there. At least stay awake. It's already been 3 hours and I think we should go tomorrow.liarThe shower is always the worst part with you. With your clothes on at least you are well hidden. The mirror in the bathroom always mocks you and you embarass me. Stop moving your arms they are far too long and not wide enough. Your a pathetic excuse for a man. You should have taken your chances as a woman. Your head looks out of place. Stop looking. We have to spend at least 5 minutes like this.the water feels good and the sounds of it hitting the floor is loud enough to not have to pay attention to you i think i will stay here for a long time---------------------------i have to leave we're running out of waterAbout time. We have to eat. There's time left to run, go to the gym, learn an instrument or two, get a job, work that job, get a job, why don't you have a job? It's because you always look so awful. You should fix that. I'll fix it. But you ruin me. Look at the time? You had all that time to do all those things and you ruined it. It's your fault, not mine.i knowI hate how people think it's my fault. Do you think it's my fault? I think people are only stay around me because of you. That is stupid. You are disgusting. I could take you out whenever I want.  Do you understand that?i don't think you could i wish you couldWell I won't. How do you like that, you fucking bastard? You're fucking filth. How does it fucking feel that I will never do that? You're a piece of shit. I just want you to feel better but how can you feel better if you're a piece of shit? Ask someone to help you.i don't want to do that again. i'm going to do that again.That felt good. Did you see the way she looked at you? I think I got her. I think I made it work even with having to drag you around. Now you won't have to feel so bad. Ask her what she likes about you, and you in specific. Why did you do that? That's so fucking embarassing. She's lying too. Look at her, she couldn't possibly believe that and if she did I can't respect her.i am lonely.So am I. It's probably my fault.

"Passage: The BetrayalWhen did it all begin? Where it always does I suppose, with the vows. Do you take this woman, to have and to hold in sickness and in health? Bullshit! Michael thought to himself. It ought to say are you taken with this woman. That’s exactly what he had been with Irene…. Taken! The better question he thought to himself as he sat there, alone in the waiting room was where did it all go wrong?Sitting there alone in the twelve feet wide by twenty-three foot long white box. Michael sat in the same waiting room chair that decorated every waiting room across the country. Two plastic arm supports thinner than any person’s forearm he had ever encountered. Who the fucks arm is this suppose to support? A predetermined back angle as if everyone set with the same posture. Michael was angry, not with the room although it did irritate and enrage him for many reason but no, Michael was angry at life and how his had turned out in particular. Sitting there in only chair in the white, picture less, waiting room Michael rotated his wedding band between his fingers like a magician does before making the coin disappear, starting at his pinky finger ending at his index finger before starting the process over again. One might look upon Michael as if he was lost in thought had they walked in on him, but he was not lost in thought for Michael knew exactly where his thoughts were at. They were on the wedding band, for that he surmised is where everything went wrong. A white gold band size ten in his case, with ten little diamond chunks set inside the band itself when it was purchased. It of course was bought as a match to Irene’s. He remembered the event like it was yesterday and not ten years ago. They had been in the mall and both spotted the Kay’s sign and went in. Irene and Michael were doing it backwards, they had married just hours earlier at the Bell County, Courthouse.Her face lit up when she saw the one carat diamond, it was one of the many smiles he would see on her face during the first two years of their marriage, but like everything else in life even the smiles fade he thought. The woman behind the counter Camille, Michael never forgot the name of a person that made Irene smile. It was a blessing back then and a curse as of the last few years. Camille placed the ring on Irene’s finger with all the tenderness and caring that Michael did not get to do back at the courthouse.He had to admit that when he first looked at the rings on their hands after they purchased them. “No need for bags he had told Camille! We will wear them out give everyone a chance to see an ordinary ring on an extraordinary woman!” Irene use to eat up his compliments back then no matter how cheesy he thought they sounded, she would always smile or squeeze his arm tighter. Yes, even he believed in the happiness they represented when they walked out of the store ten years ago to the day. Looking at the weathered ring now brought him back to a sobering reality. The scratches some deep, some minor, the diamond that fell out once and was replaced. It fell out again along the years and like most stuff in life you get tired of trying to fix it and you let it be. In some ways the wedding band had outlasted him. It was still on his fingers albeit worn and beaten but still there. Michael wished he could say the same for his Irene.He thought about how if he had never bought her the ring or stood in front of that justice of the peace then there would have never been broken promises. There never would have been late nights. There never would have been whiskey on his breath. Most of all Michael thought there never would have been him.Hindsight’s twenty/twenty his father had told him. Bill, his name was Bill. He had never had such rage in his heart for any name as he did for that name. The name that stripped everything from him, his life, his passion…his soul mate. He had never met the face behind the name; Irene had not afforded him that opportunity. Michael chose not to dwell on the memories of Bill; after all he had so few only the details that Irene had provided him before waling out of his life.She told him only enough so that he could understand why. Irene had not wanted to hurt Michael so she left out how they met after all that wasn’t important. What was important is that they met. Michael sat there in the only chair in that white picture less box of a waiting room when the buzzer sounded signaling that one patient was coming out and the next one would be buzzed in. A woman who looked to be about twenty three exited the room casually glanced at Michael before leaving.Michael stood slowly wondering if the blonde had smelled the whiskey on his breath as she passed by. If she had then she had not let on. She probably had problems of her own. The doctor stepped into the doorway bridging his office and the waiting room glancing up from his clipboard to pronounce Michaels name. Michael pointed the 357 Magnum Solid Black Revolver, one shot rang out and as the Doctor slumped to the floor Michael turned the Revolver toward his temple squeezing the wedding band tight in his left hand pulling the trigger with his right. One Shot rang out in the room as Michael’s lifeless body fell to the floor.     The size ten white gold band rolled out of his hand…..ending where it all began. Question: Answer the following question based on the above passage:Summarize Michael's relationship with Irene."	"Michael and Irene got married ten years earlier at the courthouse. Michael was in love with Irene, and she was in love with him. They were very happy for many years. However, Michael noticed that Irene stopped smiling as much as she used to, and she eventually left him for another man."
"Passage: QONQURTAI () was a Mongol prince and viceroy of Anatolia for the Ilkhanate khanate.LifeQonqurtai was born to Hulagu Khan and Ajuja Aguchi, his Khitan concubine wife. Qonqurtai was Hulagu's ninth son and was the senior commander during the reign of his brother Abaqa. He was twice appointed as viceroy of Anatolia, first during the reign of Abaqa and then under Tekuder. His winter quarters were in Kazova plains near Tokat, while his viceroyalty itself has centred around Kayseri.Rule in AnatoliaQonqurtai was appointed as commander of Ilkhanid army in Anatolia with Shams al-Din Juvayni as his vizier after the Battle of Elbistan in 1277 to support the Sultanate of Rum against revolting Turcomans.[1] He pursed Jimri, a claimant to Seljuk throne, and attacked his patrons - the Karamanids. As a consequence, Mehmet I of Karaman was captured and executed together with his sons Mahmud and Karaman in October 1277.[2] Qonqurtai further authorised Sâhib Ata to act on his behalf. He aided Kaykhusraw III's efforts to subdue Karamanids and Eshrefids in 1282. However, Qonqurtai had to cease his activities upon hearing the death of Abaqa.Upon the death of Abaqa, Qonqurtai supported Tekuder's succession in Maragha, who in return gave him the hand of Toqiyatai Khatun, a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun on 12 July 1282. He was also re-appointed as viceroy of Anatolia the same day.[3] However, later in Tekuder's reign, he shifted his alliance to Arghun, which made the former suspicious. Qonqurtai was summoned to Karabakh, accused of conspiracy and was arrested by Tegüder's son-in-law, Alinaq - the viceroy of Georgia on 17 January 1284, and was executed next day by breaking his neck.[4] Later, Arghun had put Tekuder on trial for Qonqurtai's death, who suffered the same penalty as him.PersonalityHe was described as a wise ruler in _Zafarnamah_ by Hamdullah Mustawfi,[5] while Qalawun considered him as a not only dishonorable, but also cruel man.[6]FamilyHe was married to Toqiyatai Khatun (d. 1292), a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun on 12 July 1282, and only two of his children reached adulthood.[7]:1.
