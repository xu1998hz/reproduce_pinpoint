a: Based on the provided factoids, it can be inferred that Ali Daei has the highest goals in world football, with a total of 102 goals in international matches. This is according to the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), which has ranked Daei as the top scorer in official international competitions. Daei's impressive record includes scoring 20 goals in competitive matches for Iran in 1996, including a famous four-goal haul against South Korea in the Asian Cup. He has also scored 9 goals in 17 matches for Iran in the 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign, and has reached an impressive record of 38 goals in 52 appearances for his country. Additionally, Daei has surpassed legendary players such as Ferenc Puskás, who scored 85 goals in international matches, and has become the first male player to score 100 goals in international play.

However, it is important to note that the factoids provided for Mia Hamm and Josef Bican also highlight their impressive goal-scoring records. Hamm broke the all-time international goal record with her 108th goal in a game against Brazil, and has a total of 110 goals in international matches. Bican, on the other hand, is estimated to have scored at least 805 goals in all competitive matches, which would make him the most prolific scorer of all time. He was a member of the Austrian "Wunderteam" of the 1930s and was the season's highest scorer in the whole of Europe on five separate occasions.

Overall, while Daei has the highest number of goals in international matches, it is clear that there are other players who have also achieved impressive goal-scoring records and could be considered among the highest goalscorers in world football.

However, the song's journey began earlier, as it was first released in an acoustic version on the album "Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M." in 1964. Without the knowledge of the duo's members, Columbia Records staff producer Tom Wilson overdubbed electric guitars, bass, and drums on the song in June 1965, creating a new version that was released as a single in September of the same year. This new version opened the "Sounds of Silence" album and became a major hit, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

a: The first Apple iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, after several years of development and experimentation by Apple's CEO Steve Jobs and his team. The project began in 2003, when Jobs asked Apple's engineers to explore the use of touchscreen devices and tablet computers. The team investigated the use of touchscreen technology and developed the iPhone's signature multi-touch interface, which allowed users to interact with the device using gestures such as tapping, pinching, and swiping.

In 2005, Apple partnered with Motorola to release the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. However, Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that compromising with a non-Apple designer had prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make. As a result, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR in September 2006 and began working on their own mobile device.

On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving extensive media attention. The device was released later that year on June 29, 2007. The iPhone was a revolutionary device that combined the functionality of a mobile phone, an iPod, and an internet communications device into one sleek and user-friendly package. It was the first mobile device to use a multi-touch interface and featured a large 3.5-inch touchscreen display, Wi-Fi connectivity, and a 2-megapixel camera.

The iPhone was a significant departure from traditional mobile phones and was met with both praise and criticism. Some critics praised the device's sleek design and user-friendly interface, while others criticized its lack of 3G connectivity and limited functionality compared to other smartphones on the market. Despite these criticisms, the iPhone was a commercial success and quickly became one of the most popular mobile devices on the market.

In the years following its release, the iPhone has undergone several updates and revisions, including the release of the iPhone 3G in 2008, which added 3G connectivity and GPS functionality. The iPhone has also become a popular platform for developers, with the release of the iPhone Software Development Kit (SDK) in 2008, which allowed developers to create apps for the device. Today, the iPhone remains one of the most popular and influential mobile devices on the market, with new models and features continuing to be released each year.
r1: The iPhone beta was created in 2004 to test the commands of the Apple team, and while technically may have been the first iPhone ever created, it was never released to the public, so this beta was not considered the true first iPhone. After some trial and error, the first iPhone was officially launched and made accessible to the public on June 29, 2007.
r2: There were several Apple iPhones, including the Apple iPhone beta and the Apple iPhone. The first Apple iPhone for beta testing, the Apple iPhone beta, was made in 2004. The iPhone beta was made to test the device and its functions but was never released to the public. The first Apple iPhone 1 was made and the first Apple iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.

a: The Sunbeam Alpine, a sports car produced by the Rootes Group from 1956 to 1968, would be an ideal car to catch a thief, given its unique features and history. Firstly, the Alpine was designed with a focus on speed and agility, making it a formidable vehicle for high-speed chases. Its lightweight construction and powerful engine, which produced 90 horsepower in its earliest versions and up to 120 horsepower in later models, allowed it to reach speeds of up to 100 mph. Additionally, the car's independent front suspension and live rear axle provided a smooth and responsive ride, making it well-suited for quick maneuvers and tight turns.

Moreover, the Alpine's sleek and aerodynamic design, with its curved lines and minimalist bodywork, made it a stylish and eye-catching vehicle that would be difficult to miss on the road. Its small size and two-seater configuration also made it a more agile and maneuverable car, allowing it to navigate through tight spaces and narrow streets with ease.

Furthermore, the Alpine's history is shrouded in mystery and intrigue, having been featured in the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock film "To Catch a Thief" starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Although the car's true identity in the film was later disputed, the Alpine's association with the iconic movie adds to its allure and mystique.

In terms of practicality, the Alpine's small size and lightweight construction made it an economical car to produce and maintain, with a production cost of around £750 in the late 1950s. Additionally, its use of components from other Rootes Group vehicles, such as the Hillman Husky and the Sunbeam Rapier, made it a versatile and reliable car that could be easily serviced and repaired.

Overall, the Sunbeam Alpine's combination of speed, agility, style, and history make it an ideal car to catch a thief, especially in the 1950s and 1960s when it was first produced. Its unique features and association with the iconic film "To Catch a Thief" only add to its allure and mystique, making it a car that would be both a thrill to drive and a valuable addition to any car collection.

a: Here's the comprehensive answer to the question:

Number of branches of Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) in India:

Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), after acquiring Global Trust Bank (GTB) in 2004, had a significant presence in the southern states of India. GTB had a wide reach in these regions, with 162 branches across eight states. Following the acquisition, OBC gained an increased presence in these areas, with a total of 370 branches in eight states. However, it is important to note that OBC had only ten times the staff and branches than GTB, but only four to five times as much in terms of deposits, investments, or advances. This suggests that OBC had a leaner structure compared to GTB, which may have contributed to its financial challenges.

In contrast, Central Carolina Bank and Trust (CCB), which merged with National Commerce Financial (NCF) in 2002, had a much larger presence in the United States. CCB had 370 branches in eight states, with a market capitalization of about $4.2 billion, combined assets of $15 billion, deposits of $11.3 billion, and 162 National Bank of Commerce (NBC) branches in Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas, and North Carolina. The merger of CCB and NCF created the seventh-largest bank in the United States, with SunTrust as the new parent company.

In conclusion, while OBC had a significant presence in the southern states of India, CCB had a much larger presence in the United States, with a larger number of branches, assets, deposits, and market capitalization.
r1: On 14 August 2004, following the amalgamation of Global Trust Bank, the Oriental Bank of Commerce(OBC) in India increased it's number of branches to 1092.

a: The Voortrekkers, as the Dutch-speaking settlers who participated in the Great Trek were known, arrived in South Africa in 1835, specifically in the area now known as Port Natal, after traveling over 650 kilometers from Grahamstown. They had set out on their journey in 1836, seeking to escape the British colonial administration at the Cape and to establish their own autonomous republics in the interior of the country. The Great Trek was motivated by a combination of factors, including tensions between the Boers and the British, as well as a desire to maintain their traditional way of life and to escape the developing administrative complexities of the Cape Colony.

The Voortrekkers traveled eastward, avoiding the coastal route and keeping to the flatter inland terrain, in order to reach their destination more easily. However, their journey was not without its challenges, as they faced rugged terrain, swollen rivers, and hot weather conditions. Despite these obstacles, they persevered and eventually arrived at Port Natal in February 1835, exhausted after their long and arduous journey.

The arrival of the Voortrekkers in South Africa had a significant impact on the region and its inhabitants. The Zulu Empire, which had previously dominated much of the area, was weakened by the arrival of the Voortrekkers, and the Northern Ndebele people were displaced as a result of the Great Trek. The Voortrekkers, who identified themselves as "pioneers" or "pathfinders," went on to establish several autonomous Boer republics, including the South African Republic, the Orange Free State, and the Natalia Republic. These republics were established as a result of the Great Trek and the desire of the Boers to maintain their independence and self-governance.

a: Sure, here's a comprehensive paragraph that answers the question "When was crude oil first discovered in Nigeria?" while incorporating the provided factoid context:

Crude oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1953, after decades of exploratory efforts by various companies. The history of oil exploration in Nigeria dates back to 1907, when the Nigerian Bitumen Corporation conducted exploratory work in the country. However, the efforts were disrupted by World War I, and it wasn't until the 1930s that new licenses were granted to companies like D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum. Despite their efforts, no commercial quantities of oil were found, and the licenses were eventually returned in 1923. It wasn't until 1937 that Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum, began exploratory work in the country. After several years of drilling, the first test well was drilled in the Owerri area in 1951, and oil was discovered in non-commercial quantities at Akata, near Eket in 1953. Prior to the Akata find, the company had spent around 6 million pounds in exploratory activities in the country. The discovery of crude oil in Nigeria marked the beginning of a booming petroleum industry that would go on to make the country the largest oil and gas producer in Africa. Today, Nigeria's oil and gas industry continues to play a significant role in the country's economy and global energy markets.

a: The authorship of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars, with some questioning its authenticity and attributing it to a later period, possibly around 80-115 AD. The main arguments against Pauline authorship are differences in style and theology between this letter and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, as well as the lack of any direct reference to the persecution of Christians in Thessalonica, which is mentioned in the First Epistle. Additionally, the use of the word "parousia" (presence) in 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, which is not found in the First Epistle, has been cited as evidence of a later composition.

On the other hand, scholars who support Pauline authorship argue that the similarities between the two letters, particularly in terms of language and theology, suggest that they were both written by the same author. Furthermore, the fact that 2 Thessalonians is addressed to the same community as the First Epistle, and that it responds to concerns raised by the Thessalonians in response to the First Epistle, further supports Pauline authorship.

The authenticity of 2 Thessalonians is further complicated by the fact that it addresses a specific issue that arose after the First Epistle was written, namely the question of whether those who had died would share in the parousia. This has led some scholars to suggest that the letter was written by a later author, possibly a follower of Paul, who was attempting to provide a response to this concern.

In conclusion, the authorship of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians remains a topic of debate among scholars, with both supporting and opposing arguments. While some argue that it was written by Paul, others suggest that it was written by a later author attempting to imitate Paul's style and theology. Ultimately, the authenticity of the letter will continue to be a topic of discussion and debate among scholars.
r1: The first and second thessalonians or 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians respectively are commonly attributed to Paul the Apostle, however, there are a number of modern scholars who believe that Paul may not have written these books but they may have been written by an associate or disciple of his, perhaps Timothy.
r2: The First Epistle to the Thessalonians, commonly referred to as First Thessalonians or 1 Thessalonians, is a Pauline epistle of the New Testament of the Christian Bible that is attributed to Paul the Apostle. The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, commonly referred to as Second Thessalonians or 2 Thessalonians is a book from the New Testament of the Christian Bible is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, with Timothy as a co-author. Many modern scholars agree with New Testament Scholar Ehrman that 2 Thessalonians was not written by Paul but by an associate or disciple after his death.

a: During World War I, David Lloyd George served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, leading the Wartime Coalition Government from 1916 to 1922. He took over the premiership from H. H. Asquith, who had led the country since 1908 and was the last Prime Minister to lead a majority Liberal government. Lloyd George's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by a significant shift in the country's approach to the war, as he implemented a policy of total war, complete state intervention in public affairs, and introduced new powers through the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. This move away from "business as usual" was a departure from Asquith's more cautious approach and marked a significant turning point in the country's war effort.

Lloyd George's leadership during the war also saw the first aerial bombardments of British cities, and the government responded by increasing propaganda efforts through the media, with the help of journalists such as Charles Masterman and newspaper owners like Lord Beaverbrook. Additionally, the war saw a significant shift in the country's demographics, as women entered the workforce in large numbers for the first time, and the government made concessions to trade unions to address labor shortages.

Despite his success in leading the country through the war, Lloyd George's tenure as Prime Minister was not without controversy. He faced criticism for his support of the war effort, and his leadership was marked by internal party divisions within the Liberal Party. By the 1920s, the party had splintered, and Lloyd George's leadership had become marginalized and mistrusted. He remained a prominent figure in British politics until his death in 1945 but was never able to regain the power and influence he had wielded during the war.

In contrast, H. H. Asquith, who served as Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916, took a more cautious approach to the war, and his leadership was marked by the introduction of major liberal legislation and a reduction of the power of the House of Lords. However, his government was vigorously attacked for the shortage of munitions and the failure at Gallipoli, leading to his resignation in December 1916. Asquith's legacy is complex, with some historians arguing that he was a skilled diplomat and leader who played a crucial role in shaping the modern welfare state, while others criticize his handling of the war and his inability to address the country's growing social and economic problems.

Overall, the leadership of David Lloyd George and H. H. Asquith during World War I marked a significant turning point in British history, as the country transitioned from a more cautious approach to a more interventionist one and saw the introduction of new powers and policies that would shape the course of the war and the country's future.
r1: In August 1914, British statesman and Liberal politician H. H. Asquith took Great Britain and the British Empire into the First World War while he served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1922.

At the end of World War I, David Lloyd George, the 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, was Prime Minister.

a: The 300 mile march to Sacramento, California was led by Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers (UFW) in 1966. The march, known as the "March for Justice," was a pivotal moment in the labor movement and the struggle for farmworkers' rights. The UFW, which was formed by the merger of two workers' rights organizations, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), had been organizing strikes and boycotts in California's San Joaquin Valley to demand better wages and working conditions for farmworkers. The march was a culmination of these efforts and aimed to bring attention to the plight of farmworkers and to pressure the state government to pass legislation that would protect their rights.

The march began on March 17, 1966, in Delano, California, and over the course of 25 days, the protesters, many of whom were farmworkers themselves, walked 300 miles to the state capital of Sacramento. Along the way, they faced harsh weather conditions, including rain and extreme heat, as well as opposition from the growers and law enforcement. Despite these challenges, the marchers remained resolute and determined, and their numbers swelled as they made their way across the state.

The March for Justice was a strategic move by the UFW to mobilize public support for their cause and to put pressure on the state government to take action. The march was well-organized and well-publicized, with supporters from all over the country joining the protesters along the way. The UFW also used nonviolent tactics, such as boycotts and strikes, to further their goals and to draw attention to the injustices faced by farmworkers.

The March for Justice was a turning point in the labor movement and the struggle for farmworkers' rights. It helped to galvanize public support for the UFW and its demands, and it paved the way for significant improvements in working conditions and wages for farmworkers. The march also helped to establish Cesar Chavez as a prominent leader in the labor movement and a powerful voice for the Latino community.

a: Based on the provided factoids, the oldest person in the world was Sarah Knauss, an American supercentenarian who lived to the age of 119 years and 30 days. She was born on September 24, 1880, in Hollywood, Pennsylvania, and married Abraham Lincoln Knauss in 1901. Her husband died in 1965, and their only child, Kathryn, died in 2005 at the age of 101. Sarah's longevity was recognized by Guinness World Records, and she became the world's oldest living person in 1998, following the death of Marie-Louise Meilleur, a 117-year-old Canadian.

The Gerontology Research Group (GRG), a global organization of researchers dedicated to studying aging and gerontology, verified Sarah's age and confirmed her as the oldest person in the world. The GRG requires strict documentation to verify the ages of supercentenarians, including birth and death certificates, and other official government identification.

Sarah's remarkable longevity is even more remarkable when considering that she had seven living generations in her family at the time of her death. Her lifespan is a testament to the advances in medical science and technology that have contributed to increased human lifespan over the past century.

It is worth noting that while Sarah Knauss holds the record for the oldest person in the world, her age has been disputed by some researchers. Some have suggested that her age may have been exaggerated or falsified, and there is ongoing debate within the scientific community about the validity of her record. However, based on the available evidence and verification by the GRG, Sarah Knauss remains the oldest person in the world, and her remarkable longevity continues to inspire research and interest in the field of gerontology.
r1: American supercentenarian claimant Mathew Beard was verified to be the first person in history to become 114 years old when he died in 1985. The following year in 1986, Augusta Holtz was validated as the oldest German citizen as she lived 115 years and 79 days by the time of her death in 1986. Skipping forward to 1997, French supercentenarian Jeanne Calment became the oldest human whose age is well-documented at the time of her death in August 1997. However, when it comes to the oldest person in the world whose age is undisputed is Sarah Knauss of the United States who lived to the age of 119 years and 97 days on December 30, 1999.
r2: A supercentenarian is someone who has reached the age of 110. Sarah Knauss, whose age is undisputed, was the oldest person ever from the United States and the second-oldest fully documented person ever. Jeanne Calment was a French supercentenarian and the oldest human whose age is well-documented, with a lifespan of 122 years and 164 days, and was the oldest person in the world as of 1997. In 1985, the oldest living person was Mathew Beard and in 1986 it was Augusta Holtz, who lived 115 years and 79 days, from 1871 to 1986.

a: The 12th day of Christmas begins on January 5th and ends on January 6th, which is known as Epiphany Eve. This period is also known as Christmastide or the Twelve Days of Christmas, and it is a festive season in Western Christian traditions that celebrates the Nativity of Jesus. The Twelve Days are considered to be a time of celebration and gift-giving, and they are often associated with the traditional Christian Advent season, which runs from the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day until Christmas Day itself.

However, the commercial calendar has influenced the way the Twelve Days of Christmas are perceived in modern times. In the United States, the traditional liturgical seasons of Advent and Christmas have been largely replaced by secular traditions such as Black Friday sales and New Year's Eve parties. As a result, the Twelve Days of Christmas have become obscured, and many Americans assume that they end on Christmas Day.

Despite this, many Christian denominations still observe the Twelve Days of Christmas and celebrate them with special liturgical services and traditions. For example, the Episcopal Church in the US has an invitatory antiphon in the Book of Common Prayer for Matins during the Twelve Days of Christmas. Additionally, some Christians give gifts on each of the Twelve Days, with each day representing a wish for a corresponding month of the new year.

Overall, the 12th day of Christmas begins on January 5th and ends on January 6th, and it is a significant period in Western Christian traditions that celebrates the Nativity of Jesus. While secular traditions have obscured the Twelve Days of Christmas in modern times, many Christian denominations still observe this festive season with special liturgical services and traditions.
r1: In most Western ecclesiastical traditions, the 12th day of christmas is January 5th. The 12 days of christmas begin December 25 to January 5. According to the commercial calendar, the first day of Christmas (December 25) is considered the last day of the "Christmas" marketing season, as demonstrated by the numerous "after-Christmas sales" that commence on 26 December. When it comes to Eastern Christianity i.e. Oriental Orthodox (other than the Armenians), the Eastern Orthodox, and the Eastern Catholics, Christmas and Epiphany are celebrated by these churches on 25 December and 6 January using the Julian calendar, which correspond to 7 January and 19 January using the Gregorian calendar. The Twelve Days, using the Gregorian calendar, end at sunset on 18 January.
r2: The start and end, or 12th day, of the Twelve Days of Christmas are held to be on a number of different dates. In most Western ecclesiastical traditions, Christmas Day is considered the First Day of Christmas and the Twelve Days are 25 December through 5 January, with January 5 being the final and 12th day of Christmas. In Eastern Christianity, the 12th day is held to be on 18 January. Conversely, the commercial calendar holds that the Twelve Days are 14 December to 25 December, with Christmas Day being the 12th day.

a: Alabama became a right-to-work state in 2016, when Governor Robert Bentley signed the Alabama Workplace Freedom Act into law. This law prohibits union security agreements between employers and labor unions, which means that employees in unionized workplaces are not required to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. The law was enacted as part of a broader effort to attract businesses and jobs to the state, and was seen as a victory for business interests and the Republican-led legislature. The law was signed on February 11, 2016, and went into effect on June 1, 2016.

The passage of the Alabama Workplace Freedom Act was part of a larger trend of right-to-work laws being enacted in states across the country. According to the Legal Defense Foundation, right-to-work laws are currently effective in 27 states, mostly in the Southern, Western, and Midwestern regions of the United States. These laws have been supported by business interests, such as the United States Chamber of Commerce, who argue that they are necessary to promote economic growth and job creation.

However, the passage of right-to-work laws has also been controversial, with opponents arguing that they can lead to lower wages and weaker labor unions. In Alabama, the law was met with opposition from labor unions and Democratic lawmakers, who argued that it would lead to a decline in union membership and a loss of collective bargaining power for workers.

Despite these criticisms, the Alabama Workplace Freedom Act was seen as a significant victory for Governor Bentley and the Republican-led legislature, who had made passing a right-to-work law a priority. The law was also seen as a potential boon for businesses looking to locate in the state, as it was seen as a way to attract new investment and create jobs.

Overall, the passage of the Alabama Workplace Freedom Act was a significant development in the state's labor politics, and was part of a larger trend of right-to-work laws being enacted across the country. While the law has been controversial, it has also been seen as a way to promote economic growth and job creation in the state.

a: The song "I'll Be Seeing You" was featured in the 2004 film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel "The Notebook." However, the song has a unique history that predates the film. It was originally recorded by Jimmy Durante, an American singer, pianist, comedian, and actor, in 1963. Durante's version of the song became a best-seller and was featured in several of his films, including "Sleepless in Seattle." The song was also included on the soundtrack of "The Notebook," which starred Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as the young lovers Noah and Allie.

The connection between "I'll Be Seeing You" and "The Notebook" is not just a coincidence. According to Nicholas Sparks, he was inspired to write the novel by the long romantic love of his wife's grandparents, who were married for over 60 years when he met them. Sparks wanted to express the enduring love of this couple in his novel, and he found inspiration in Durante's version of "I'll Be Seeing You." The song's lyrics, which speak of a love that will endure even though the two lovers are apart, resonated with Sparks and helped him to capture the essence of the love story he wanted to tell.

In addition to its connection to "The Notebook," "I'll Be Seeing You" has a rich history in American popular culture. Durante recorded the song for his album "September Song" in 1963, and it became a best-seller. The song has since been covered by many other artists, including Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday. It has also been featured in several films and television shows, including "Sleepless in Seattle" and "The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson."

Overall, "I'll Be Seeing You" is a song with a rich history and a special connection to "The Notebook." Its enduring love and nostalgic lyrics make it a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences to this day.

a: The authorship of the books of the New Testament is a complex and longstanding topic of debate among scholars. While traditional attributions of authorship have been passed down through the centuries, many critical scholars today question the accuracy of these ascriptions. According to Bart Ehrman, a prominent New Testament scholar, many of the books of the New Testament were not written by the individuals whose names are attached to them. In fact, he argues that the Gospels were originally anonymous, and names were not ascribed to them until around 185 AD.

One of the most contested issues in New Testament authorship is the identity of the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. While the prefaces of both books attribute them to a person named Theophilus, many scholars believe that these books were written by different authors. Some argue that the Gospel of Luke was written by a Gentile, while others believe that it was written by a Hellenistic Jew. The Acts of the Apostles, on the other hand, is thought to have been written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke, and is therefore referred to as the Lucan texts.

The Pauline epistles, which include the thirteen letters traditionally attributed to Paul of Tarsus, are another area of debate. While many scholars accept the traditional view that these letters were written by Paul, some question whether the first three, called the "Deutero-Pauline Epistles," are authentic. The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is also a subject of debate, with many scholars rejecting Pauline authorship.

The Pastoral epistles, which include 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, are generally considered to be pseudonymous, with most scholars rejecting the traditional view that they were written by Paul. The Epistle to the Laodiceans and the Third Epistle to the Corinthians are also considered to be pseudonymous.

The authorship of the Gospel of John is also a topic of debate, with some scholars arguing that it was written by the Apostle John, while others believe that it was written by a different author. The Epistle of James, which is attributed to James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, is another book whose authorship is contested. While some ancient and modern scholars have argued that the epistle was written by James the Just, others believe that it was written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries by an unknown author.

In conclusion, the authorship of the books of the New Testament is a complex and multifaceted issue, with many scholars questioning the traditional attributions of authorship. While some books, such as the Pauline epistles and the Gospel of Luke, are generally accepted as being written by the individuals whose names are attached to them, others, such as the Gospel of John and the Epistle of James, are the subject of ongoing debate and discussion. Ultimately, the authorship of the New Testament books is a matter of interpretation and belief, and will likely continue to be a topic of discussion and debate among scholars for years to come.
r1: The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by Jewish Christians (Jewish disciples of Christ) who lived in the Roman Empire, however, not all the authors were Jewish Christians. It is believed that disciples Matthew, Mark, Luke, John wrote the gospels of the New Testament. The other books like the Pauline epistles are traditionally attributed to Paul of Tarsus, the Epistle of James is attributed to James (a servant of God), while Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ wrote the First Epistle of Peter. A number of scholars are divided as to whether Luke (who wrote the Gospel of Luke) was a Gentile or a Hellenistic Jew.
r2: The New Testament of the Bible is primarily written in parts with the majority of it written by Jewish disciples of Christ. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John wrote the gospels. The First Epistle of Peter was written by Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, Epistle of James was written by James, a servant of God, and the Pauline Epistles was written by Paul of Tarsus.

a: The repetition of phrases or sentences with similar structures or meanings is called parallel syntax or parallel construction. This rhetorical device is used to emphasize a central theme or idea by repeating it in multiple sentences or clauses, providing a sense of balance and harmony to the text. The repeated phrases or sentences can be identical or slightly varied, creating a sense of repetition with a purpose. This technique is effective in improving the flow of a sentence, making it more concise and direct, and it can also appeal to the reader or listener on multiple levels.

One of the primary benefits of parallel syntax is that it enhances the reader's ability to process the text. Studies have shown that the repetition of clauses can increase the speed at which an individual can process a sentence, and it also decreases the amount of information that needs to be processed, making comprehension easier. Additionally, the emotional appeal of parallel syntax should not be underestimated. Aristotle believed that persuasion can be achieved through the use of parallel syntax, as it creates a sense of repetition that embeds the idea into the listener, making it more memorable and persuasive.

Parallel syntax is closely related to another rhetorical device called schesis onomaton, which involves constructing a sentence using only nouns and adjectives. This technique is often used to emphasize a particular idea or theme, and it can be effective in creating a sense of repetition and balance in the text. However, it is important to note that schesis onomaton can also be used in a more general sense to refer to any series of words that are synonymous expressions, and it is not limited to nouns and adjectives.

In conclusion, parallel syntax is a powerful rhetorical device that can be used to emphasize a central theme or idea, improve the flow of a sentence, and appeal to the reader or listener on multiple levels. It is closely related to other rhetorical devices such as schesis onomaton, and it is an effective tool for any writer or speaker looking to create a sense of balance and harmony in their text.
r1: The difference between Parallel Syntax (also known as parallel construction and parallelism) and Schesis onomaton is that Parallel Syntax is a rhetorical device that consists of repetition among adjacent sentences or clauses while Schesis onomaton is a rhetorical technique used to emphasize an idea by repeating it rapidly using slightly different words that have the same or a very similar meaning.
r2: In rhetoric, Parallel Syntax (also known as parallel construction and parallelism) is a rhetorical device that consists of repetition among adjacent sentences or clauses. The repeated sentences or clauses provides emphasis to a center theme or idea the author is trying to convey. Schesis onomaton is a rhetorical technique used to emphasize an idea by repeating it rapidly using slightly different words that have the same or a very similar meaning.

a: The last time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series before 2016 was in 1908. The Cubs defeated the Detroit Tigers in five games, winning their second consecutive World Series title. This was significant because it was the last World Series championship the Cubs would win for 108 years, as they went on to appear in seven World Series between 1908 and 2016, but lost each time. The 1908 World Series was notable for being the first rematch of a World Series, as the Cubs and Tigers had faced off in the previous year's series. The series was marked by a controversial play known as "Merkle's Boner," which allowed the Cubs to reach the World Series after a tie game against the New York Giants. The 1908 World Series was also notable for being the most poorly attended in history, with the final game drawing only 6,210 fans. The Cubs' drought between World Series championships is a record in Major League Baseball, and their 2016 championship was a long-awaited and historic moment for the team and its fans.

a: In Act 5, Scene 5 of William Shakespeare's "Macbeth," the titular character delivers a famous soliloquy beginning with the words "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow." This soliloquy is a poignant reflection on the ravages of time and the toll it has taken on Macbeth's soul. The speaker, once a brave and respected general, has become a tyrannical and guilt-ridden king, consumed by the ambition that drove him to murder his own king and seize the throne.

The soliloquy is delivered as Macbeth hears the cry of a woman, which would once have sent shivers down his spine, but now he is so desensitized to horror and violence that it fails to stir him. This desensitization is a direct result of the bloodbath he has unleashed upon Scotland, and the countless lives he has taken in his quest for power. Macbeth's reflection on the passage of time is a stark contrast to his earlier self, when he was full of "horrors and slaughterous thoughts" (5.5.19).

The soliloquy is also a commentary on the futility of life and the inevitability of death. Macbeth notes that "tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" (5.5.16) will come and go, but the present moment is all that truly exists. This is a poignant observation, as Macbeth is about to face his own death at the hands of Macduff, and the finality of death is weighing heavily on his mind.

Furthermore, the soliloquy highlights the theme of the corrupting influence of power and ambition. Macbeth's desire for power and his willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve it has led him down a path of destruction and madness. He is now so consumed by his own guilt and paranoia that he is unable to feel any emotion other than a numb acceptance of his fate.

In conclusion, the soliloquy "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow" is a powerful and poignant moment in "Macbeth," and it highlights the themes of the corrupting influence of power and ambition, the futility of life, and the inevitability of death. Macbeth's reflection on the passage of time is a stark reminder of the toll that his own actions have taken on his soul, and the finality of his own death is a reminder that all human beings are ultimately subject to the same fate.
r1: In the play The Tragedy of Macbeth, the character Macbeth states "it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury" as part of one of the most famous soliloquies in William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth.

This record has stood the test of time, despite the fact that the game has evolved over the years with changes in rules, player talent, and scoring opportunities. In contrast, Kobe Bryant's 81-point game in 2006, which is the second-highest total in NBA history, was achieved in a game where the Lakers trailed at halftime and Bryant had to create his own shots, unlike Chamberlain's game where he was fed repeatedly by his teammates in a blowout win. Additionally, Chamberlain's record is even more impressive when considering that he accounted for 59% of his team's points, while Bryant only accounted for 66% of the Lakers' 122 points. Other notable records set by Chamberlain in that game include the most points in a quarter (32 in the first quarter), most free throws made (28), and all of his other records set that day still stand. Interestingly, the highest-scoring game in NBA history was not achieved by Chamberlain, but by the San Antonio Spurs and the Milwaukee Bucks in a triple overtime game in 1982, where the two teams combined for 337 points. However, this record was broken just over a year later by the Detroit Pistons and the Denver Nuggets in a game that also went into triple overtime, with a total of 370 points scored.
r1: The most points ever scored in an NBA regular season game came in 1983 when the Pistons defeated the Nuggets 186–184 in a triple overtime game that resulted in a combined score of 370 points. In that same game was another record of the most points scored in an nba game by a single team which came to 186 (Pistons). The most points scored (162) by a single team in a regular season game during regulation was in 1990 when the Warriors defeated the Nuggets 162-158. The most points scored (153) by a single team in a playoff game was in 1992 when the Phoenix Suns defeated the Trail Blazers 153-151. Finally, the most points scored in an NBA game by an individual was done by the Philadelphia Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain who scored an NBA-record 100 points in a single game.
r2: In basketball, points are used to keep track of the score in a game. The most points scored in a NBA game by combined teams is 370, and the most points scored in a NBA game by a single team is 186. The most points scored in a NBA game by an individual is 100. The highest amount of points scored by a single team in regular season games in regulation is 162. The highest amount of points scored by a single team in playoff games is 153.

a: Lipid testing is an essential component of a comprehensive health assessment, and there are several methods used to determine the presence and levels of lipids in the body. The most common method is the lipid profile, which includes a series of blood tests that measure various lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides. The results of this test can provide valuable information about the risk of cardiovascular disease, pancreatitis, and other health conditions. In addition to the lipid profile, the emulsion test is another method used to detect the presence of lipids. This test involves suspending a sample in ethanol, allowing lipids to dissolve, and then adding water to the solution. The resulting cloudy white emulsion indicates the presence of lipids.

The lipid profile typically includes several tests, such as the total cholesterol, LDL or "bad" cholesterol, HDL or "good" cholesterol, and triglycerides. These tests provide information about the balance of lipids in the body and can help identify potential health risks. For example, high levels of LDL cholesterol can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, while low levels of HDL cholesterol can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Additionally, the lipid profile can help diagnose certain genetic diseases, such as familial hypercholesterolemia.

The Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines recommend screening for lipid disorders in healthy adults with no cardiovascular risk factors every five years. However, individuals with risk factors, such as a family history of heart disease or high blood pressure, may need to be screened more frequently. Children and adolescents are not typically screened for lipid disorders unless they have a family history of these conditions or other risk factors.

In conclusion, lipid testing is an important tool for assessing the balance of lipids in the body and identifying potential health risks. The lipid profile and emulsion test are two common methods used to detect the presence and levels of lipids, and the results of these tests can help guide treatment decisions and preventive measures to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other health conditions.
r1: A lipid profile or "lipid panel" is a panel of blood tests that serves as an initial screening tool for abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides in the body. The emulsion test however, is a method to determine the presence of lipids using wet chemistry. This same method can test for lipids in food as well.

The emulsion test is a method to determine the presence of lipids using wet chemistry. The procedure is for the sample to be suspended in ethanol, allowing lipids present to dissolve. The liquid, which is alcohol with dissolved fat, is then decanted into water. Since lipids do not dissolve in water, when the ethanol is diluted, it falls out of the solution to give a cloudy white emulsion.

a: Here's a comprehensive paragraph that answers the question "Who wrote 'Give Me a Home Among the Gumtrees'?" and provides context and analysis:

"Give Me a Home Among the Gumtrees" is a popular Australian song that was written in 1974 by Wally Johnson and Bob Brown, also known as Captain Rock. The song was originally performed as a satirical number in their comedy act at the Flying Trapeze Cafe in Melbourne and was later recorded on the Captain Rock album "Buried Treasure" in 1975. At the time, the Australian government was holding a contest to find a new national anthem, and "Gumtrees" was Johnson and Brown's response to the contest (it did not win). The song became a hit for the band The Emu, who recorded a cover version in 1982, and it has since been covered by other artists such as John Williamson. The song has become a beloved Australian classic and has been performed at various events, including a memorial service for Steve Irwin in 2006, which was broadcast to a global audience of 300 million viewers. Co-writer Wally Johnson passed away in 1995, but Bob Brown continues to write and perform tongue-in-cheek folk songs, including children's songs and songs that have been covered by other artists.

a: Construction on the Sydney Harbour Bridge began on 28 July 1923, with the official turning of the first sod taking place at Milsons Point on the north shore. The construction process started with the building of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926, concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would "creep" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. On 26 October 1928, arch construction began, and the two halves of the arch touched for the first time on 19 August 1930. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. The joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom from the jibs of the creeper cranes. Once the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical hangers were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931. The creeper cranes were dismantled, and rails for trains and trams were laid, along with the surfacing of the roadway using concrete topped with asphalt. Power, telephone, water, gas, and drainage pipes were also added to the bridge in 1931. The construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was a complex and challenging process that required careful planning and execution, but the end result was a magnificent structure that has become an iconic symbol of Sydney and one of the most recognizable landmarks in Australia.

a: In the popular sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond," the original twins were named Matthew and Gregory in the pilot episode, but were later changed to Geoffrey and Michael due to the creator and star, Ray Romano, finding it inconvenient to have the same names for his TV children as his real-life children. This change was made to avoid confusion and to differentiate the TV family from Romano's real-life family. The twins, Geoffrey and Michael, were regular characters on the show but were not a major focus, with the storylines primarily revolving around the family patriarch, Raymond Barone, and his wife, Debra. The show ran for nine seasons from 1996 to 2005 and was well-received by audiences and critics alike, earning numerous awards and nominations during its run.

a: The greatest warrior for the Trojans during the Trojan War was undoubtedly Hector, the eldest son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba. As the heir apparent to the throne, Hector was not only a skilled fighter but also a natural leader, rallying the Trojans and their allies in the defense of their city. According to Hyginus, Hector killed 31,000 Greek fighters during the war, a testament to his exceptional bravery and martial prowess.

Despite his reputation as a fierce warrior, Hector was also depicted as a noble and courtly figure, cherishing his relationships with his family and his city. Homer portrays him as a peace-loving and thoughtful individual, who is deeply devoted to his wife Andromache and his young son Scamandrius. This nuanced characterization of Hector highlights the complexity of his personality and his commitment to the values of loyalty, duty, and family.

The historical evidence supporting Hector's existence is limited, but the few available sources, such as Hittite cuneiform texts and Linear B tablets, confirm his importance as a figure in the Trojan War. Additionally, the fact that his tomb was allegedly transported to Thebes according to a Delphic oracle, as reported by Pausanias, further underscores his legendary status and the reverence with which he was held by the ancient Greeks.

Overall, Hector's reputation as the greatest warrior for the Trojans is well-deserved, based on both the historical evidence and the depictions of him in Greek mythology. His bravery, leadership, and commitment to his people and his values make him a compelling and enduring figure in the annals of history.

a: The United States entered World War II in Europe on December 8, 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Prior to the attack, the United States had maintained formal neutrality, while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war materiel through the Lend-Lease Act. The U.S. military was also deployed to replace British invasion forces in Iceland. Despite later rumors, there was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan, and the attack caught the U.S. Pacific Fleet by surprise. The attack on Pearl Harbor was a failure for the Japanese, as the lost battleships were obsolete and the lost planes were soon replaced. However, the attack had the opposite effect on the United States, electrifying public opinion and committing the country to a war to the death against the Japanese Empire. President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially pronounced December 7, 1941, as "a date which will live in infamy" and asked for a declaration of war on Japan before a joint session of Congress on December 8, 1941. The motion passed with only one vote against it, and just three days later, on December 11, 1941, Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States.

The entry of the United States into World War II marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as the country's industrial and military might helped to shift the balance of power in favor of the Allies. The U.S. military, led by General George Marshall and the Army Air Forces under General Hap Arnold, played a crucial role in the war, with over 16 million Americans serving in the military and over 400,000 killed in action. The U.S. also provided significant financial and material support to the Allies, with the Lend-Lease Act providing billions of dollars in aid to Britain and the Soviet Union.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been a central figure in the U.S. response to the war, played a key role in shaping the country's wartime strategy and diplomacy. He was a dominant leader of his party and a central figure in world events, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the Great Depression and building the New Deal Coalition, which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System. Roosevelt's leadership during the war helped to define American liberalism and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest U.S. presidents, along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
r1: Prior to the United States entering world war II, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Lend-Lease Act on 11 March 1941 to ensure the supply of war materials to Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. On 7 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States officially joined the second world war. A few days later (on 11 September 1941), President Roosevelt publicly confirmed the "shoot on sight" order, effectively entering the war.

a: The President of the Senate in the Texas Legislature is the Lieutenant Governor, who serves as the highest-ranking official in the Senate and has a significant amount of power and influence over the legislative process. The Lieutenant Governor appoints chairs of committees, committee members, and assigns and refers bills to specific committees, and has the power to recognize members during debate and make procedural rulings. Additionally, the Lieutenant Governor may cast a vote in the event of a tie in the Senate floor vote. The Lieutenant Governor is considered one of the most powerful positions in the Texas Senate, and the President Pro Tempore, who presides over the Senate when the Lieutenant Governor is not present or when the legislature is not in regular session, is the second most powerful position. The President Pro Tempore is usually the most senior member of the Senate and is reserved to any political party in the chamber regardless of whether it is a majority or minority.

The current Lieutenant Governor of Texas is Dan Patrick, and the President Pro Tempore is Republican Kel Seliger of District 31 (Amarillo). The Dean of the Senate is Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston, who is the most senior member of the Senate, having served since 1987. The most senior member of the Republican Party is Senator Chris Harris of Arlington, who is the fourth most-senior overall member. The Texas Senate has a total of 31 members, with 19 Republicans and 12 Democrats.

The Texas Senate has a unique system of leadership, without a majority or minority leader, and instead relies on the President Pro Tempore to preside over the chamber.

a: The downfall of the Inca Empire can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the devastating effects of diseases such as smallpox and typhus, the Spanish conquest and colonization, and the exploitation of the indigenous population through forced labor and the mita system. The Inca Empire was already weakened by internal conflicts and the loss of its leader, Atahualpa, when the Spanish arrived in 1532. The Spanish conquest was brutal and ruthless, with the Spanish killing many Incas and destroying their culture and traditions. The Spanish also brought with them diseases such as smallpox, which spread rapidly throughout the empire and decimated the population.

One of the most significant factors in the downfall of the Inca Empire was the smallpox epidemic of 1546, which killed an estimated 30% of the population. This left the empire weakened and vulnerable to further attacks from the Spanish and other diseases. The Spanish also brought measles, influenza, and diphtheria to the empire, which further devastated the population. The loss of so many people, particularly the leaders and elites of the empire, made it difficult for the Inca to resist the Spanish conquest.

The Spanish colonization also had a significant impact on the Inca Empire. The Spanish imposed their own language, religion, and customs on the indigenous population, leading to the suppression of Inca traditions and culture. The Spanish also established the mita system, which required indigenous people to work in gold and silver mines, often under harsh conditions. This exploitation of the indigenous population further weakened the empire and led to resentment and resistance among the people.

In addition to these factors, the Inca Empire was also affected by internal conflicts and power struggles. After the death of Atahualpa, his brother, Huascar, claimed the throne, leading to a civil war that weakened the empire. The Spanish took advantage of these internal conflicts to further their own goals and expand their empire.

Overall, the downfall of the Inca Empire was the result of a combination of factors, including the devastating effects of diseases, the Spanish conquest and colonization, and the exploitation of the indigenous population. These factors, combined with internal conflicts and power struggles, ultimately led to the downfall of one of the most powerful empires in pre-Columbian America.
r1: During the time of the largest empire in pre-Columbian America (Inca), diseases (primarily the smallpox epidemic) and the invasion of the Spanish conquistadors all contributed to the downfall of the empire.
r2: The downfall of the Incan Empire can be linked to both disease and Spanish conquistadors. The first epidemic was smallpox, followed by other diseases including a probable Typhus outbreak, influenza, diphtheria and measles all of which ravaged the Inca people. Likewise, the long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors on the population of South America were catastrophic. The Incan population suffered an exceptionally dramatic and rapid decline following contact with the Spanish.

a: The Seljuk Empire began in the early 11th century and lasted until the mid-12th century, spanning approximately 60 years. The empire was founded by Tughril, an Oghuz Turk leader, who became the first Sultan of the Seljuk Empire in 1037. Tughril died in 1063, and his death led to a succession crisis, as his nephew Qutalmish challenged the claim of his cousin, Tughril's chosen successor, Suleyman. This conflict culminated in the Battle of Damghan in 1063, which marked the beginning of the Seljuk Civil War. The war lasted for several years and ended with the victory of Malik Shah I, another cousin of Tughril, who became the new Sultan of the Seljuk Empire. The Seljuk Empire reached its peak during the reign of Malik Shah I, who expanded the empire's territories and established a strong centralized government. However, the empire began to decline after Malik Shah I's death in 1092, and it eventually collapsed in the early 12th century, divided into smaller territories ruled by local governors.
r1: The Seljuk Empire was founded in 1037 and began to decline in the 1140s, and by 1194 had been supplanted by the Khwarezmian Empire.

a: The St. Louis Cardinals moved to Arizona in 1988 due to a combination of factors, including the team's financial struggles and the desire of owner Bill Bidwill to relocate to a more favorable market. The team had been struggling financially for several years, and the aging Busch Memorial Stadium was not generating enough revenue to sustain the team. Additionally, Bidwill was facing pressure from the NFL to improve attendance, as the team's poor performance and lack of success on the field had led to dwindling fan support.

In 1987, the Cardinals had a stunning comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but this was not enough to reverse the team's fortunes. The team finished the season with a 5-11 record, and attendance continued to decline. As a result, Bidwill began exploring the possibility of relocating the team to a more lucrative market.

Bidwill considered several potential locations, including Baltimore, Phoenix, and Jacksonville, before ultimately deciding on Phoenix. The NFL owners voted to allow Bidwill to move the team to Arizona in March 1988, and the team became known as the Phoenix Cardinals.

The decision to move the team to Arizona was not without controversy, as many fans in St. Louis were devastated by the loss of their team. Bidwill faced criticism from fans and local officials, who felt that the team was being taken away from them without adequate notice or support. Despite these challenges, Bidwill was determined to relocate the team to a more promising market, and he ultimately succeeded in his efforts.

The Cardinals played at Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium for 18 years before moving to their current home, State Farm Stadium, in 2006. The team has experienced some success since relocating to Arizona, including a Super Bowl appearance in 2009. Despite the challenges of the early years, the Cardinals have established themselves as a strong and competitive team in the NFL, and they continue to have a dedicated fan base in the Phoenix area.
r1: On March 15, 1988, the NFL team owners voted to allow Bidwill to move the Cardinals from St. Louis to Tempe, Arizona for the 1988 NFL season due to the overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with an old stadium, which caused game attendance to dwindle.
r2: The professional American football team now known as the Arizona Cardinals previously played in St. Louis, Missouri as the St. Louis Cardinals from 1960 to 1987 before relocating to Tempe, Arizona in 1988. The overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with an old stadium, caused game attendance to dwindle, and once again the Bidwills, American businessman and the owner of the Arizona Cardinals, decided to move the team.

a: In the 1994 American family comedy adventure musical film "Baby's Day Out," the role of the adorable baby "Baby Bink" was played by twin babies, Adam Robert and Jacob Joseph Worton. Despite the film's critical and financial failure, the movie enjoyed immense popularity in India and other South Asian markets. The film's success in these markets can be attributed to the relatable and endearing portrayal of Baby Bink, who is pursued by three kidnappers throughout the film.

Interestingly, the role of Baby Bink was played by twin babies, Adam Robert and Jacob Joseph Worton, who were only a few months old during filming. The twins were chosen for the role after a former president of Little People of America contacted the film's producers looking for someone of a "certain size" to serve as a stunt double for the infant character. The film's director, Patrick Read Johnson, has stated that the twins were chosen for their identical appearance and their ability to cry on command.

The film's failure to perform well at the box office can be attributed to several factors, including its high budget of $48 million and the fact that it was released during a crowded summer movie season. However, the film's popularity in India and other South Asian markets highlights the enduring appeal of the baby's adventure storyline and the relatable portrayal of Baby Bink.

In a tragic twist of fate, the actor who played the role of Mini-Me in the "Austin Powers" film series, Verne Troyer, passed away in 2018. Troyer, who was born with cartilage-hair hypoplasia, stood at just 2 feet 8 inches tall and was one of the shortest men in the world. Despite his physical limitations, Troyer had a successful acting career and appeared in several films and television shows, including "Baby's Day Out." Troyer's legacy lives on through his memorable performances, and his impact on the entertainment industry will be remembered for years to come.

a: The United States abandoned the gold standard in 1971, marking a significant shift away from the commodity-based currency system and towards fiat money. This move was prompted by the increasing costs of the Vietnam War and the declining gold reserves of the United States, which made it difficult to maintain the promise of redeeming dollars in gold. The Bretton Woods agreement, which fixed the value of the US dollar to gold at $35 per ounce, was no longer sustainable, and the Nixon Shock of 1971, which included the unilateral cancellation of the direct convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively ended the gold standard. This move away from the gold standard was met with opposition from the United States Greenback Party, which termed it as "fiat money" in an 1878 party convention. The shift towards fiat money allowed governments to print more money without the constraint of gold reserves, leading to a period of hyperinflation in some countries, such as the Weimar Republic. Since then, the US dollar has been a fiat currency, with its value determined by supply and demand on foreign exchange markets rather than by any commodity standard.
r1: On June 5, 1933, the US discontinued the gold standard, but still allowed foreign governments to trade gold for dollars. In 1971, the US unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US dollar to gold foreign central banks thus completely severing any links to the gold standard.
r2: The dates the US went off the gold standard and completely severed links to it differ. Upon taking office in March 1933, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt departed from the gold standard. The US went off the gold standard on June 5, 1933, but still allowed foreign governments to trade gold for dollars. It wasn't until 1971 that the US completely severed any link to the gold standard.

a: As blues music migrated into Chicago's South Side, it underwent a significant transformation and evolved into a distinct style known as Chicago blues. This new style was characterized by an electric blues sound that was heavily influenced by the urban environment of Chicago and the experiences of African American musicians who had migrated from the South. Unlike traditional country blues, which often focused on themes such as rural life and hardship, Chicago blues tackled the challenges and struggles of city living, such as poverty, racism, and the struggles of industrial work.

The development of Chicago blues was heavily influenced by Mississippi bluesmen who traveled to Chicago in the early 1940s, bringing with them their unique styles and techniques. These musicians, such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Willie Dixon, were able to adapt their sound to the urban environment of Chicago, incorporating elements of jazz, swing, and soul music to create a distinctively urban blues sound.

The commercial success of Chicago blues was driven by the promotion of record companies such as Paramount Records, RCA Victor, and Columbia Records, which helped to bring the music to a wider audience. The new style of music eventually reached Europe and the United Kingdom, where it had a profound influence on the development of rock and roll and other popular music genres.

Chicago blues was characterized by its use of electric instruments, such as electric guitars and amplifiers, which gave the music a louder and more energetic sound than traditional acoustic blues. The music also featured a strong emphasis on vocal performance and storytelling, with lyrics that often spoke to the experiences and struggles of urban life.

The legacy of Chicago blues can be heard in the work of many well-known musicians, including Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Willie Dixon, and Koko Taylor. These musicians, along with many others, helped to shape the sound of Chicago blues and bring it to a wider audience. Today, the music continues to be celebrated and performed by blues musicians around the world, and its influence can be heard in a wide range of popular music genres.
r1: As blues moved into Chicago's south side, an electric blues style of urban blues known as Chicago blues was developed. The promotion of record companies such as Paramount Records, RCA Victor, and Columbia Records drove blues to the international stage and influenced young British musicians, resulting in the British blues movement.
r2: Chicago blues is a form of blues music developed in Chicago, Illinois. It is based on earlier blues idioms, such as Delta blues, but performed in an urban style. The first blues clubs in Chicago were mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods on the South Side, with a few in the smaller black neighborhoods on the West Side. As the new style of music eventually reached Europe and the United Kingdom, young British musicians were highly influenced by Chicago blues, resulting in the British blues movement.

a: The movement of food in the food pipe is called peristalsis. Peristalsis is a wave-like muscular contraction that occurs in the esophagus, which helps to push food down the throat and into the stomach. This process is triggered by the sensation of food in the mouth and in the esophagus itself, and is facilitated by the relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter and the contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter. The movement of food through the esophagus is also aided by the intrinsic muscles of the tongue, which form a trough at the back of the tongue to contain the food and help it move downwards towards the throat. Additionally, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea, and gastric acid is produced in the stomach to enable food digestion. Overall, the movement of food through the food pipe is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple muscles and nerves to ensure that food is properly digested and absorbed by the body.
r1: Swallowing is the mechanical action that moves food into the esophagus. The autonomic function that moves food from the esophagus to the stomach is known as peristalsis.
r2: The mechanical action that moves food into the esophagus is called swallowing. Swallowing is an important part of eating and drinking. The autonomic function that moves food from the esophagus to the stomach is called peristalsis. In much of a digestive tract such as the human gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscle tissue contracts in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave, which propels a ball of food along the tract.

a: The development of the Gram stain, a widely used method for identifying and classifying bacteria, is attributed to Hans Christian Gram, a Danish bacteriologist who developed the technique in 1884 while working with Carl Friedländer in the morgue of the city hospital in Berlin. Gram staining differentiates bacteria based on the physical properties of their cell walls, specifically the presence or absence of peptidoglycan, a substance found in the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria, on the other hand, have a very small layer of peptidoglycan that is dissolved by alcohol, resulting in a different staining pattern. The Gram stain is a valuable diagnostic tool in both clinical and research settings, but it is not infallible and cannot identify bacteria to the species level. Additionally, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, also known as the acid-fast stain, is used to identify acid-fast organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is responsible for tuberculosis. This stain is particularly useful for identifying Mycobacterium species that are resistant to the Gram stain. Overall, the development of the Gram stain and the Ziehl-Neelsen stain has significantly advanced our ability to identify and classify bacteria, allowing for more accurate diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections.
r1: In 1884, Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram developed a useful staining method to identify bacteria in two large groups (a technique known as Gram staining). Another kind of staining known as Ziehl–Neelsen staining is a type of Acid-fast stain was first introduced by German physician and scientist Paul Ehrlich but named after the two German doctors who modified the stain: the bacteriologist Franz Ziehl (1859–1926) and the pathologist Friedrich Neelsen (1854–1898).
r2: Gram stain or Gram staining, also called Gram's method, is a method of staining used to distinguish and classify bacterial species into two large groups, Gram-positive and Gram-negative.

a: The solid part of the Earth is called the mantle, which is the layer beneath the crust that extends from a depth of about 35 kilometers (22 miles) to a depth of 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium, and it is divided into two sections: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle is composed of rock that is hot but still solid, while the lower mantle is made up of rock that is molten, or melted. The boundary between the two layers is known as the mantle-core boundary, and it is located at a depth of about 410 kilometers (255 miles).

The mantle is under such intense pressure that it is unable to flow easily, but it does exhibit ductile deformation, meaning that it can be stretched and deformed without breaking. This property allows the mantle to flow over long timescales, driving the process of plate tectonics. The mantle is heated by the primordial heat left over from the planet's formation, as well as by the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in the Earth's crust and mantle.

The inner core of the Earth is a solid, iron-nickel alloy that is located at the center of the planet. It is estimated to be about 1,220 kilometers (760 miles) in radius and is surrounded by the liquid outer core, which is made up of a mixture of molten iron and nickel. The inner core is believed to be composed primarily of iron and nickel, and it is under such intense pressure that it is unable to melt, even at the extremely high temperatures found within the Earth's core. The inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann, and its existence was confirmed by seismic measurements.

Overall, the solid part of the Earth is the mantle, which is composed of hot, ductile rock that flows over long timescales and drives the process of plate tectonics. The inner core is a solid, iron-nickel alloy that is located at the center of the planet and is surrounded by the liquid outer core.
r1: With a radius of ≈1,220 km, the inner core is the solid inner part of the earth. The outer part of earth can be divided into the oceanic and continental lithospheres. This area includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitutes the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth. The Earth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890 km, making it the thickest layer of Earth.
r2: There are several solid parts of the Earth. The solid inner part of the Earth is called the inner core, one of two parts of the core.

a: The authorship of the first five books of the Torah, also known as the Pentateuch, is a complex and debated topic among biblical scholars. According to rabbinic tradition, these books were written by Moses, who received the teachings directly from God at Mount Sinai and at the Tabernacle. However, the majority of biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian captivity, based on earlier written and oral traditions that could only have arisen from separate communities within ancient Israel.

The documentary hypothesis, proposed by Julius Wellhausen, suggests that the Pentateuch was composed from four main sources: the Yahwist source, the Elohist source, the Deuteronomist source, and the Priestly source. These sources were combined and edited by a final redactor to create the final form of the Pentateuch.

The Yahwist source is believed to have been written in the 9th or 8th century BCE and is characterized by the use of the name Yahweh (Jehovah) for God. The Elohist source is thought to have been written in the 8th or 7th century BCE and uses the name Elohim (God) for God. The Deuteronomist source is dated to the 7th century BCE and is characterized by its emphasis on the importance of obedience to the law. Finally, the Priestly source is believed to have been written in the 5th or 4th century BCE and is characterized by its focus on ritual and priestly practices.

Despite the debated authorship of the Pentateuch, the Torah remains a central text of Judaism and is considered to be the foundation of Jewish law and tradition. The Torah is written in Hebrew and is read publicly at least once every three days in the presence of a congregation. The meaning of the word "Torah" is "teaching", "doctrine", or "instruction", and it is believed to have been created prior to the creation of the world and used as the blueprint for Creation.

In conclusion, the authorship of the first five books of the Torah is a complex and debated topic among biblical scholars. While rabbinic tradition attributes the authorship to Moses, the majority of scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian captivity and were composed from multiple sources. Regardless of the authorship, the Torah remains a central text of Judaism and is considered to be the foundation of Jewish law and tradition.
r1: The first five books of Moses in the Hebrew Bible (commonly known as the Written Torah) are believed to have have been written by the prophet Moses. By contrast, the modern scholarly consensus rejects Mosaic authorship and affirms that the Torah has multiple authors, the number of authors involved and the date of each author remain hotly contested, however. In the 1700s, JEDP became considered to be the author of the first five books of Moses. However, the unnamed author is listed as the authors of the first five books of Moses. Later on, German biblical scholar Julius Wellhausen believed that Ezra the Priest is a redactor of the first five books of Moses.
r2: Torah has a range of meanings, and it can most specifically mean the first five books, the Pentateuch or five books of Moses, of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible. The Talmud holds that the Torah was written by Moses, with the exception of the last eight verses of Deuteronomy, describing his death and burial, being written by Joshua. According to Jewish tradition, the Torah was recompiled by Ezra during Second Temple period, and Wellhausen believed that Ezra was a redactor of the first five books of Moses. In the 1700s, JEDP was considered the author of the first five books of Moses. An unnamed author is listed as the author of the first five books of Moses.

a: The Union victory at the Battle of Philippi in West Virginia on June 3, 1861, marked the first organized land action of the American Civil War and was a significant turning point in the conflict. The battle was fought between Union forces led by Major General George B. McClellan and Confederate forces under the command of Colonel George A. Porterfield. Despite being outnumbered, the Union troops were better trained and equipped, and they utilized a clever strategy to deceive the Confederates into thinking they were heading towards Harpers Ferry, instead of Philippi. This misdirection allowed the Union forces to attack the Confederates from the rear, catching them off guard and causing them to flee with little resistance.

The battle was notable for several reasons. Firstly, it was the first time that Union troops had engaged in a significant battle on Southern soil, and it marked the beginning of a wider campaign to control the western counties of Virginia, which eventually led to the formation of the state of West Virginia. Additionally, the battle was the first to result in battlefield amputations, and it brought overnight fame to McClellan, who was hailed as a hero by the Northern press.

The Union victory at Philippi also had significant consequences for the Confederacy. The defeat forced the western counties of Virginia to consider their allegiance to the Confederate cause, and many began to question whether they should remain part of the secessionist state. This led to the formation of a new Union state government in West Virginia, which further weakened the Confederacy and strengthened the Union's position in the war.

In conclusion, the Battle of Philippi was a significant turning point in the American Civil War. It marked the first organized land action of the conflict, resulted in a Union victory, and had far-reaching consequences for the Confederacy. The battle demonstrated the strategic genius of McClellan and the bravery of the Union troops, and it set the stage for future battles and campaigns in the war.
r1: The 1861 Battle of Philippi during the American Civil War was fought in and around present day West Virginia. The Union victory brought overnight fame to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan who was accompanied by Thomas A. Morris and Isaac Duval.

a: The ancient Chinese civilization began in approximately 1600 BC during the Shang dynasty, which is the earliest known written record of Chinese history. The Shang ruled in the Yellow River valley, which is considered the cradle of Chinese civilization. However, Neolithic civilizations originated at various cultural centers along both the Yellow River and Yangtze River, which existed millennia before the Shang. The Zhou dynasty, which introduced the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, replaced the Shang and began to weaken in the 8th century BC, leading to a period of instability and the eventual splintering of the country into smaller states. During this time, prominent philosophers such as Confucius emerged and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. The seven large and powerful states of the Warring States period were eventually conquered by the state of Qin in 221 BC, which established the Qin dynasty and unified the core of the Han Chinese homeland for the first time. The Qin dynasty quickly collapsed after the death of its leader, Ying Zheng, and was replaced by the Han dynasty in 206 BC, marking the beginning of a golden age of Chinese culture, economy, and military power. The capital of the Han dynasty was initially at Chang'an, but it was later moved to Luoyang in 25 AD in response to a coup.

a: During his reign in the 13th century, King John made significant modifications to Kenilworth Castle, which is located in the English county of Warwickshire. To protect the castle from potential flooding and provide a water defense system, John dammed the Finham Brook and its tributary, the Canley Brook, creating a lake in the process. This effort was part of a larger plan to fortify the castle and its surroundings, as Kenilworth was an important strategic location during John's reign. The castle's proximity to the brooks and the lake created a natural barrier against potential invaders, and the damming of the brooks allowed for the creation of a water defense system that could be used to flood the surrounding area if necessary. Additionally, the construction of the dam and the lake also provided a source of water for the castle and its inhabitants.

King John's efforts to fortify Kenilworth Castle were not limited to the damming of the brooks. He also built a tiltyard, which was a large open space used for jousting and other martial activities, and a great hall, which was a grand residence for the king and his guests. These additions, along with the damming of the brooks, helped to transform Kenilworth Castle into a formidable stronghold that could withstand potential attacks and provide a secure base of operations for the king.

It is worth noting that King John's reign was marked by a number of significant events and conflicts, including the loss of the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, which contributed to the collapse of the Angevin Empire and the growth of the French Capetian dynasty. Additionally, John's reign was marked by a baronial revolt at the end of his reign, which led to the sealing of the Magna Carta, a document that is sometimes considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom. Despite these challenges, however, King John's modifications to Kenilworth Castle demonstrate his commitment to strengthening his defenses and solidifying his power in the region.
r1: Between 1210 and 1216, King John of England spent £1,115 on rebuilding and enhancing the Kenilworth Castle. This was done by building the outer bailey wall in stone and improving the other defences, including creating the Mortimer's and Lunn's Towers. He also significantly improved the castle's water defences by damming the Finham and Inchford Brooks, creating the Great Mere.
r2: Kenilworth Castle, in the town of Kenilworth in Warwickshire, England, was founded during the Norman conquest of England with development through to the Tudor period.

a: The girl in the ZZ Top "Legs" video is Wendy Frazier, a model and actress who was chosen by the band to star in the video based on her striking resemblance to a young Marilyn Monroe. The video, which was released in 1984, was the third and final installment in the Eliminator series of videos and marked a departure from the band's previous videos by featuring a female protagonist instead of a male one. In the video, Frazier plays a harassed salesgirl who is rescued by a handsome young cook (played by David Wakefield) and then transformed by the ZZ Top "Eliminator girls" (played by Jeana Tomasino, Kymberly Herrin, and Danièle Arnaud) into a confident, empowered woman.

The video was significant for its portrayal of a strong, independent woman who is able to stand up to her tormentors and find happiness with a supportive male partner. The video also featured the band's signature blend of blues-infused rock and roll and sleek, high-tech production values, which helped to cement their status as one of the most innovative and influential bands of the 1980s.

The "Legs" video was also notable for its use of symbolism and imagery, such as the pink stockings and garters worn by the Eliminator girls, which were intended to represent the objectification of women in society and the power of female sexuality. The video's themes of transformation and empowerment were also reflected in the song's lyrics, which were written by ZZ Top's frontman Billy Gibbons and guitarist Frank Beard.

Overall, the "Legs" video was a key moment in ZZ Top's career, as it showcased the band's ability to create visually stunning and thought-provoking videos that were just as memorable as their music. The video has since become a classic of 1980s music video culture and continues to be celebrated for its blend of style, substance, and sexuality.
r1: In the 1984 zz top legs music video, a pretty salesgirl (Wendy Frazier) suffers harassment after entering a burger joint. When she returns to her place of work (the shoe store), she endures more harassment and misfortune from her coworkers but is eventually saved and protected by a group of girls (the Eliminator girls - Jeana Tomasino, Kymberly Herrin, and Danièle Arnaud) who then present the salesgirl to the American rock band ZZ Top.
r2: "Legs" is a song performed by the band ZZ Top from their 1983 album Eliminator. The "Legs" video was the third and last of the Eliminator series of videos that introduced the now-iconic 1933 Ford, "Eliminator girls", Jeana Tomasino, Kymberly Herrin, and Danièle Arnaud, and ZZ Top-as-benevolent-spirits tropes, all of which have become firmly established aspects of the band's iconography.

a: The song "In the Ghetto" has a rich history, with two different versions recorded by notable artists Elvis Presley and Busta Rhymes. The original version was written by Mac Davis and made famous by Elvis Presley in 1969. The song tells the story of generational poverty and violence in the ghetto, with a narrative that follows a boy born to a mother who already has more children than she can feed. The boy grows up hungry, steals and fights, purchases a gun, and ultimately meets a tragic end just as his own child is born. The song's structure, with its simple and stark phrasing, repetition of the phrase "in the ghetto," and the repetition of the first verse's "and his mama cries" create a feeling of an inescapable cycle of poverty and violence.

On the other hand, Busta Rhymes recorded a remix of the song in 2006, featuring R&B singer Rick James. The remix, produced by DJ Green Lantern and Dr. Dre, samples James' "Ghetto Life" from his "Street Songs" album. The video for the song features cameos from several notable artists, including Snoop Dogg, MC Eiht, Warren G, and Ludacris. The remix adds a new verse by Busta Rhymes and Ludacris, and was released in Ludacris' mixtape, "Pre-Release Therapy".

Interestingly, both versions of the song were recorded by artists who were at different points in their careers. Elvis Presley's version was recorded during his comeback session in 1969, after a period of declining popularity, while Busta Rhymes' version was recorded during the peak of his career. Despite the differences in style and era, both versions of "In the Ghetto" share a common message about the cycle of poverty and violence in the inner city, and the impact it has on the lives of those living there.

Overall, "In the Ghetto" is a powerful and thought-provoking song that has been interpreted in different ways by two distinct artists. While Elvis Presley's version is a classic of the rock and roll genre, Busta Rhymes' remix brings a new perspective to the song with its modern production and featuring of Rick James. Both versions are significant in their own right, and offer a glimpse into the struggles and challenges faced by those living in the inner city.
r1: The 1969 song "In the Ghetto" (originally titled "The Vicious Circle") was recorded by American singer and actor Elvis Presley and written by Mac Davis.

a: The title of Lorraine Hansberry's play, "A Raisin in the Sun," is inspired by the poem "Harlem" by Langston Hughes, which asks the question "What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?" The poem speaks to the idea that when dreams are put on hold or denied, they can wither away and lose their potential for growth and fulfillment. This theme is central to the play, as the Younger family, the main characters, are struggling to achieve their dreams in the face of poverty, racism, and societal expectations.

The play is set in the Washington Park Subdivision of Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood, where the Younger family lives in a dilapidated two-bedroom apartment. The family is struggling to make ends meet, and the father, Walter, has a plan to invest in a liquor store in partnership with two street-smart acquaintances. The mother, Ruth, is content with their lot, but Walter is driven by a sense of entitlement and a desire for wealth. The play explores the tensions between Walter's dreams and the realities of their lives, as well as the impact of racism and sexism on the family's experiences.

The title of the play is a metaphor for the dreams of the characters, which are constantly being deferred and put on hold. Just as a raisin in the sun would dry up and lose its flavor, the characters' dreams are in danger of withering away under the weight of their circumstances. The play highlights the importance of pursuing one's dreams and aspirations, even in the face of adversity, and the need to challenge societal norms and expectations in order to achieve true fulfillment.

The fact that the play is set in Chicago and explores the experiences of a black family living under racial segregation is also significant. The play is a powerful commentary on the injustices of racism and the ways in which it affects the lives of black Americans. The title of the play, taken from Langston Hughes' poem, adds a deeper layer of meaning and context to the story, highlighting the importance of dreams and the need to pursue them in order to achieve true happiness and fulfillment.
r1: A Raisin in the Sun is a 1959 play by playwright Lorraine Hansberry. The title of the play was inspired by the poem called "Harlem" (also known as "A Dream Deferred") by American poet Langston Hughes. The story tells of a black family's experiences in south Chicago, as they attempt to improve their financial circumstances with an insurance payout following the death of their father.
r2: A Raisin in the Sun is a play that debuted on Broadway in 1959. The title was inspired by a poem called Harlem, also known as A Dream Deferred, which was written by Langston Hughes. The poem is about a Black family in south Chicago that attempts to improve their financial circumstances.

a: In the book "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer, the climber who died was Andy Harris, who was one of the guides leading Krakauer's expedition. However, the book also mentions the deaths of several other climbers, including Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa, who was a guide for Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness expedition. Lopsang was one of the most experienced and respected Sherpa guides on the mountain, and he played a crucial role in helping several climbers reach the summit of Everest. Tragically, he was one of the climbers who perished on May 11, 1996, when a rogue storm hit the mountain and caused widespread chaos and destruction.

a: Sure! Here is a comprehensive, well-structured answer to the question "How long is a Rainbow Six Siege game?" that integrates the given factoid context:

A Rainbow Six Siege game typically lasts for four minutes in casual matches and three minutes in ranked matches. This time frame includes a one-minute preparatory period where attackers and defenders choose their spawn points and set up their defenses, followed by a four-minute (or three-minute in ranked) round where players engage in intense, close-quarters combat. During the round, players can use operators, gadgets, and weapons to outmaneuver and eliminate the opposing team. If a player is killed, they can enter "Support Mode" and use drones to scout the map and provide information to their teammates. The match ends when one team achieves the objective or all players on one team are eliminated. The length of each round and the number of rounds played per match can vary depending on the game mode and the skill level of the players. Overall, a typical Rainbow Six Siege game can last anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes, with longer matches typically occurring in ranked play.

The factoid context provided adds additional information about the game's premium currency, R6 credits, which can be used to purchase operators and other cosmetic items. It also highlights the game's focus on environmental destruction and cooperation between players, as well as the different gameplay modes available.

a: The film "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" was primarily filmed in Sylva, North Carolina, with additional locations in Black Mountain, North Carolina and Douglas Lake, Tennessee. The iconic billboards that serve as the film's central focus were built by Allison Outdoor Advertising of Sylva and were placed in a pasture near Black Mountain. However, due to the controversial nature of the billboards' message, they were often covered up by locals who found them upsetting. The film's production team had to use a different location for the billboards, and they were eventually dismantled and used for another purpose.

The film's lead actress, Frances McDormand, initially felt that her character Mildred was too young as written and suggested that she be revised as Angela's grandmother. However, the film's writer and director Martin McDonagh disagreed, feeling that it would change the story too much. McDormand's husband Joel Coen ultimately persuaded her to take the role, and she drew inspiration for her character from John Wayne. Sam Rockwell, who plays the role of Jason Dixon, took inspiration for his character from Lee Marvin, who starred alongside Wayne in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance".

Principal photography began on May 2, 2016, and ran for 33 days, with most of the filming taking place in Sylva and Black Mountain. The Town Pump Tavern in Black Mountain was used as a set and was closed for three days during filming, during which time a pool table and booths were added to the location.

a: In association football, a player can be substituted during a match for a variety of reasons, including fatigue, injury, poor performance, or tactical reasons. The substitute enters the field of play during a stoppage in play and must be granted permission by the referee before doing so. The player being substituted must leave the field of play before the substitute can enter, and the substitute can only enter the field at the halfway line. The team is limited to making a maximum of three substitutions during a normal match, with a fourth substitution allowed in extra time.

The rules regarding substitutions have evolved over time, with the Premier League increasing the number of players on the bench to five in 1996 and allowing seven players on the bench for the 2008-09 season. The Laws of the Game specify that a player who has been substituted may take no further part in the match, and unused substitutes and players who have been substituted remain under the authority of the referee and can be cautioned or punished for misconduct.

The use of substitutes is an important tactical tool for teams, allowing them to bring on fresh players to change the pace of the game or address specific weaknesses in their lineup. However, the substitution rule also provides a mechanism for teams to replace injured or tired players, which can help to prevent injuries and ensure the safety of the players.

In recent years, the use of substitutes has become more common in international tournaments, with the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup final all allowing a fourth substitution in extra time. The 2018 FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League, and the UEFA Europa League have also approved the use of a fourth substitute in extra time in elimination rounds.

Overall, the substitution rule in association football provides teams with the flexibility to adjust their lineup during a match, while also ensuring the safety and well-being of the players. By allowing teams to bring on fresh players and replace injured or tired players, the rule helps to promote fair play and enhance the overall quality of the game.
r1: In most soccer matches, three substitutions can be made during the game (regulation) and a fourth substitution can be made during extra time. Substitutions are made during a stoppage in play and with the permission of the referee.
r2: In soccer, most games only allow each team to make a maximum of three substitutions during a game and a fourth substitute during extra time, although the rules are more relaxed during less official games.

a: The author of the renowned romance "Le Morte d'Arthur" is widely accepted to be Sir Thomas Malory, born in 1416 to Sir John Malory of Newbold Revel, Warwickshire. While the exact identity of the author has been the subject of speculation due to the existence of multiple historical figures with the same name, the text itself provides evidence supporting Sir Thomas Malory's authorship. In the work, the author describes himself as "Knyght presoner Thomas Malleorre" ("Sir Thomas Maleore" according to the publisher William Caxton), which scholars have taken as strong evidence for his identification. Sir Thomas Malory inherited the family estate in 1434, but by 1450 he had become fully engaged in a life of crime, adding another layer of intrigue to his already mysterious life. Despite this, "Le Morte d'Arthur" has endured as one of the most beloved and influential works of Arthurian literature in English, with many modern writers drawing upon Malory's text as their principal source. The work's publication in 1485 by William Caxton, the first book printed on a printing press in England, further cemented its place in literary history.

The song's opening lines, "Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?" are reminiscent of the opening lyrics of "I'm Wishing." The song's composition is a testament to the Beatles' ability to draw inspiration from a wide range of sources and incorporate them into their own unique sound.

a: The statue in Piccadilly Circus is called the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, which features an aluminum statue of Anteros, the "Angel of Christian Charity." The fountain was built in 1893 to honor Lord Shaftesbury, a British philanthropist, but it was mistakenly believed to be a statue of Eros, the Greek god of love. The fountain was designed by Alfred Gilbert and features a figure of Anteros, who is depicted with outstretched wings and a flowing cloak. The statue is surrounded by two smaller fountains, which were added in 1845 to break up the open space of the square and to reduce the potential for unruly street demonstrations. The fountains were designed by architect Charles Barry and were originally powered by a steam engine behind the National Gallery.

a: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, one of the largest environmental disasters in history, has cost BP a staggering $54 billion in clean-up, environmental, and economic damages, and penalties. In November 2012, BP pleaded guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to Congress, and agreed to a record-setting $4.525 billion in fines and other payments. Additionally, the company was temporarily banned from new contracts with the US government. The total cost of the spill, including criminal and civil settlements and payments to a trust fund, reached $42.2 billion.

The ruling in September 2014 by a US District Court judge found that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill due to its gross negligence and reckless conduct. The judge stated that BP employees took risks that led to the largest environmental disaster in US history and that the company was reckless in its decision-making. This ruling may result in an additional $18 billion in damages, four times the Clean Water Act maximum penalties. BP strongly disagreed with the ruling and filed an immediate appeal.

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP-operated Macondo Prospect. The spill was estimated to be 8% to 31% larger in volume than the previous largest, the Ixtoc I oil spill. After several failed efforts to contain the flow, the well was declared sealed on September 19, 2010. Reports in early 2012 indicated that the well site was still leaking. A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands, and estuaries from the spreading oil, utilizing skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns, and oil dispersant. The spill had extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries, with oil cleanup crews working four days a week on Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013.

The misuse of categorical exclusion for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance, as described in Regulatory Capture, relates to this spill and highlights the need for stricter regulations and accountability for corporations operating in the oil industry. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has had a profound impact on the environment, the economy, and the reputation of BP, and serves as a cautionary tale for the dangers of prioritizing profits over safety and environmental concerns.
r1: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was an industrial disaster that began on 20 April 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP-operated Macondo Prospect. BP and the United States Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4.525 billion in fines and other payments. Cleanup costs, charges and penalties had cost the company more than $65 billion. In September 2014, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill because of its gross negligence and reckless conduct. In July 2015, BP agreed to pay $18.7 billion in fines, the largest corporate settlement in United States history.

a: The origins of music can be traced back to prehistoric times, with the oldest known musical instruments dating back to around 40,000 years ago. The discovery of flutes made from yew wood in a wood-lined pit near Greystones, Ireland, in 2004, and the "Divje Babe Flute", a cave bear femur dated to be approximately 43,500 years old, provide evidence of the existence of music in prehistoric cultures. However, the claim that the femur is indeed a musical instrument is contested by alternative theories, such as the suggestion that it may have been gnawed by carnivores to produce holes.

The prehistoric age is considered to have ended with the development of writing, and with it, the ability to document and preserve music. As a result, the music of this period is largely unknown, and what little is known is based on archaeological evidence and theoretical reconstructions. The oldest known song, written in cuneiform and dating back to 3400 years ago from Ugarit in Syria, provides a glimpse into the musical traditions of ancient civilizations. This song, known as the Hurrian hymn no. 6, was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer and was found to be composed in harmonies of thirds, similar to ancient "gymel", and using a Pythagorean tuning of the diatonic scale.

The history of music is closely tied to the history of human culture and society, and is influenced by a wide range of factors, including social and economic organization, climate, and access to technology. Music has been a fundamental constituent of human life for at least 50,000 years, and has evolved over time to reflect the changing needs and experiences of different cultures. The study of music history, particularly Western art music, is a distinct subfield of musicology and history that examines the chronological development of music, from prehistoric times to the present day.
r1: The history of music covers the historical development and evolution of music from prehistoric times to present day. The "oldest known song" was written in cuneiform, dating to 3400 years ago from Ugarit in Syria. The first piece of unwritten music was made prior to the Paleolithic age 3.3 million years ago.
r2: Though definitions of music vary wildly throughout the world, every known culture partakes in it, and music is thus considered a cultural universal. The first piece of non-written music was made prior to the Paleolithic age, circa 3.3 million years ago. The "oldest known song" was written in cuneiform, dating to 3400 years ago from Ugarit in Syria.

a: During the Reagan Era of the 1980s, modern conservatives sought to reduce the role of government in the economy and society. This was reflected in President Reagan's major policy priorities, which included increasing military spending, cutting taxes, reducing federal spending, and restricting federal regulations. The goal was to stimulate economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, which would in turn lead to higher revenues and a reduction in the national debt. To achieve this, the Reagan administration introduced the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which enacted a 27% across-the-board federal income tax cut over three years, as well as a separate bill that reduced federal spending, especially in anti-poverty programs. However, the administration's policies were met with resistance from Democrats, who believed that the tax cuts and increased military spending were exacerbating the national debt and harming social programs. Despite these challenges, the Reagan administration argued that the tax cuts were the primary factor in turning the economy around, and their policies helped to shape the modern conservative movement in the United States.
r1: In the 1980s, modern conservatives wanted to reduce federal spending, specifically in anti-poverty programs. They wanted to reduce the marginal income tax rate on the wealthiest Americans and reduce the spread of Soviet communism in Latin America, Africa and worldwide.

The Rangers' Stanley Cup victory in 1993-1994 was their first in 54 years, and it marked a significant moment in the team's history.

The Rangers have a rich history in the NHL, being one of the Original Six teams and the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the Stanley Cup. The team was founded in 1926 by George Lewis "Tex" Rickard, who was awarded an NHL franchise for Madison Square Garden to compete with the now-defunct New York Americans. The Rangers have since established themselves as a successful and storied franchise, with four Stanley Cup championships under their belt. However, the 1993-1994 season was a particularly notable period for the team, as it marked their first Stanley Cup victory in over half a century and featured a talented roster of players who helped the team achieve great success on the ice.

a: The primary purpose of a traffic circle, also known as a roundabout, is to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic flow at intersections. By permitting traffic to flow in one direction around a central island, roundabouts reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions compared to traditional intersections with stop signs or traffic signals. This is achieved by reducing traffic speeds and minimizing T-bone and head-on collisions. Additionally, roundabouts simplify the pedestrian's visual environment by only allowing traffic to exit in one direction, making it easier for pedestrians to cross the street safely. The slow speed of traffic in roundabouts also allows drivers to visually engage with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them.

Moreover, roundabouts reduce driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduce queuing associated with traffic lights. This is because roundabouts eliminate the need for drivers to wait for a green light or stop sign, allowing them to flow smoothly through the intersection. Furthermore, roundabouts allow U-turns within the normal flow of traffic, which is not possible at other forms of junctions. This increased flexibility can help to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

Another benefit of roundabouts is that they can lead to less pollution. Since vehicles on average spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout can result in lower emissions and a cleaner environment. Overall, the purpose of a traffic circle is to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of traffic flow at intersections, making it a valuable tool for urban planning and transportation management.
r1: A roundabout is a type of round (about) intersection or junction in which road traffic is permitted to flow in one direction around a central island, and priority is typically given to traffic already in the junction. In terms of safety, it greatly reduces the likelihood and severity of collisions. It also serves an environmental benefit in that it potentially leads to less pollution.
r2: A traffic circle has multiple purposes. In terms of safety, traffic circles reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions greatly. In terms of environmental benefits, it potentially leads to less pollution. Its purpose in how it establishes a flow of traffic is that traffic is permitted to flow in one direction around a central island.

In the early 20th century, procedures such as pneumothorax and surgical interventions were used to treat TB, but it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that the first effective antibiotics were discovered.

In 1944, Albert Schatz, Elizabeth Bugie, and Selman Waksman isolated streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB. This discovery marked the beginning of the modern era of TB treatment and paved the way for the development of other effective antibiotics.

However, the true revolution in TB treatment did not begin until the 1950s with the development of isoniazid, the first oral mycobactericidal drug. Isoniazid, along with other antibiotics such as rifampin, significantly reduced the number of TB cases and hastened recovery times.

The advent of these antibiotics was made possible by the discovery of Amycolatopsis rifamycinica, a species of bacteria that produces the rifamycin antibiotics. Amycolatopsis rifamycinica was first isolated from a French soil sample in 1957 and has since been renamed several times. The discovery of this bacterium and the antibiotics it produces has been crucial in the fight against TB and other mycobacterial diseases.

Despite these advances, the search for a cure for TB continues, with ongoing research and development of new antibiotics and treatments to combat drug-resistant strains of the disease. The history of TB treatment is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the importance of continued scientific inquiry in the face of a persistent and deadly disease.
r1: In the quest to find a cure for tuberculosis, several methods have been developed overtime. The surgical intervention, pneumothorax, which is the collapsing of an infected lung to "rest" it and allow the lesions to heal—was used to treat tuberculosis. In 1834, F.H. Ramadge induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. Later, in 1906, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin developed a drug against tuberculosis from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis, the first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis. In addition, Albert Schatz, Elizabeth Bugie, and Selman Waksman developed Streptomycin, the first effective antibiotic for tuberculosis and the first effective antibiotic against "M. tuberculosis". Since then, medical researchers Walsh McDermott made his own contribution when he tested the first oral mycobactericidal drug on tuberculosis. Finally, in 1957, scientist Piero Sensi and Maria Teresa Timbal became the first to isolate Rifamycins, a group of antibiotics that particularly effective against mycobacteria, and are therefore used to treat tuberculosis.
r2: Throughout history, the disease tuberculosis has been variously known as consumption, phthisis, and the White Plague. F.H. Ramadge induced the first successful therapeutic pneumothorax in 1834, and reported subsequently the patient was cured. The first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis was developed from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin in 1906. In 1944 Albert Schatz, Elizabeth Bugie, and Selman Waksman isolated streptomycin produced by a bacterial strain "Streptomyces griseus." Streptomycin was the first effective antibiotic against "M. tuberculosis". The first oral mycobactericidal drug on tuberculosis was tested by Walsh McDermott. In the 1970, Lepetit Pharmaceuticals and Piero Sensi and MarMaria Teresa Timbal came up with a drug that shortened recovery and reduced cases of tuberculosis.

a: The Bill of Rights, initially applied only to the federal government, was later incorporated to apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1868. This incorporation doctrine was established in the landmark case of Gitlow v. New York (1925), in which the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment's protection of free speech applied to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment. The incorporation of the Bill of Rights has been a gradual process, with various portions of the Amendments being applied to the states over time. The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, specifically prohibits the federal government and states from denying citizens the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. However, despite the incorporation of the Bill of Rights and the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court has historically interpreted these protections narrowly, allowing for the implementation of various barriers to voter registration in southern states during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
r1: The 14th and 15th amendments of 1868 and 1870 respectively, were a ratification to the United States' Constitutional bill of rights that gave more rights to the states and people over time.
r2: By incorporation through both the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, various portions of the Bill of Rights have been held to be applicable to the state and local governments. Incorporation is the doctrine by which portions of the Bill of Rights have been made applicable to the states. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, the courts held that the Bill of Rights did not place limitations on the authority of the state and local governments.

a: The team with the most VFL/AFL premierships is Essendon, with 16 titles. Essendon, along with Carlton and Collingwood, have dominated the competition, winning 41 of the premierships between them from 75 Grand Finals in the 90 seasons between 1897 and 1986, accounting for 83.3% of all Grand Finals and a 45.6% premiership success rate. However, since the introduction of the AFL salary cap in 1987, the distribution of premierships has become more even, with 13 clubs winning the championship in the past 30 seasons. This is largely due to the implementation of zoning, which ensures that each club has a exclusive zone from which to recruit players, reducing the dominance of a select few clubs. Additionally, the salary cap has limited the spending power of the richest clubs, allowing other teams to compete more evenly. Notably, Sydney, who struggled for many years, has since become a strong contender, winning two premierships since 2005. Overall, the AFL salary cap and zoning have had a significant impact on the competitiveness of the league, creating a more level playing field and allowing a wider range of clubs to win the premiership.
r1: The Australian Football League (AFL) formerly known as the Victorian Football League (VFL) is made up of a men's division, men's reserves, men's under-19 and a women's premiership side as well.

a: Mother India, a powerful and poignant film directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Nargis, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1958. Despite being India's first submission for the category and receiving widespread critical acclaim, the film ultimately lost to Federico Fellini's Nights of Cabiria by a single vote. This loss was particularly disappointing for Khan, who believed that his film was superior to the other nominees.

Mother India tells the story of a woman who embodies the spirit of India, struggling to raise her children and maintain her family's well-being in the face of poverty, societal pressures, and personal tragedy. The film was praised for its earthy, realistic portrayal of Indian life and its powerful performances, particularly by Nargis in the title role. The film's success was not limited to its Oscar nomination, as it also won several Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director for Khan, Best Cinematographer for Faredoon Irani, and Best Sound for R. Kaushik.

In order to appeal to the Academy and increase its chances of winning, the film's international version was edited to 120 minutes and included English subtitles. However, this version was not without controversy, as it dropped Mehboob Productions' logo, which featured the Communist hammer and sickle, to appease the Academy. Despite these efforts, Mother India ultimately lost to Nights of Cabiria, a film that also received widespread critical acclaim and tells the story of a prostitute in Rome searching for true love.

Despite the loss, Mother India remains a landmark film in Indian cinema and a powerful portrayal of the struggles of the common man. Its success and impact on Indian cinema are undeniable, and it continues to be celebrated and studied by film scholars and enthusiasts alike. The film's themes of family, sacrifice, and the power of the human spirit continue to resonate with audiences today, making it a timeless classic that will endure for generations to come.

a: The legal drinking age in the United States was raised to 21 across all states in 1986, following the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984. Prior to this, 12 states had maintained a purchase age of 21 since the repeal of Prohibition, while others had lower ages, with some states raising their ages in response to the growing concern about drunk driving fatalities. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act was a controversial law that withheld federal highway funds from states that did not raise their purchase ages to 21, leading all 50 states and the District of Columbia to comply by mid-1988. The law did not outlaw the consumption of alcohol by those under 21, but rather punished states that allowed persons below 21 to purchase and publicly possess alcoholic beverages. Despite its name, the law did not seek to criminalize alcohol consumption during religious occasions such as communion wines or Kiddush. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among some Americans, as it is higher than the age of majority and the drinking ages of most other countries. While there have been proposals to lower the drinking age in some states, Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in 2010. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act has been amended to lower the penalty for non-compliance to 8% of federal highway funds starting from fiscal year 2012.
r1: On July 17, 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession of alcoholic beverages to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds.
r2: In the United States, a law was passed on July 17, 1984 making the uniform legal drinking age 21. Known as The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, it was passed by the United States Congress and was later signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The states had to have their drinking ages raised to 21 by October 1986.

a: In 1922, Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party took control of the Italian government, marking the beginning of the Kingdom of Italy under Fascism. According to Payne (1996), the Fascist government passed through several distinct phases. The first phase, from 1923 to 1925, was characterized by a legally-organized executive dictatorship, while the second phase, from 1925 to 1929, saw the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper. The third phase, from 1929 to 1934, was marked by less activism, while the fourth phase, from 1935 to 1940, was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy, including the war against Ethiopia and confrontations with the League of Nations. The final phase, from 1940 to 1943, saw the disasters and defeats of the war, and the rump Salò Government under German control. Throughout these phases, the Fascist government imposed totalitarian rule, crushed political and intellectual opposition, and promoted economic modernization, traditional social values, and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church.

a: The question of who was considered the father of the blues is a complex one, as there were several influential musicians who contributed to the development of the genre. However, among them, W. C. Handy, Charley Patton, and Muddy Waters are often cited as the most significant figures in the history of the blues.

W. C. Handy, known as the "Father of the Blues," was a composer and musician who was born in Florence, Alabama in 1873. Handy was an educated musician who used elements of folk music in his compositions, and he was scrupulous in documenting the sources of his works. He took the blues, a regional music style with a limited audience, to a new level of popularity, and his compositions, such as "St. Louis Blues" and "Beale Street Blues," became standards of the genre. Handy's music was characterized by its soulful, emotive quality, and his use of folk elements, such as the slide guitar and the 12-bar structure, helped to define the blues sound.

Charley Patton, considered by many to be the "Father of the Delta Blues," was a musician who created an enduring body of American music and inspired most Delta blues musicians. Patton was born in Hinds County, Mississippi, and lived most of his life in Sunflower County. He was known for his powerful, soulful voice and his skilled guitar playing, and his music was characterized by its raw, emotional intensity. Patton's music was influential in the development of the Delta blues style, and his recordings, such as "Pony Blues" and "High Water Everywhere," are considered classics of the genre.

Muddy Waters, known as the "father of modern Chicago blues," was a blues singer-songwriter and musician who was born in Mississippi in 1913. Waters grew up playing the guitar and harmonica, and he was influenced by local blues artists such as Son House and Robert Johnson. He moved to Chicago in 1943 and began playing professionally, and his recordings with the Chess Records label in the early 1950s, such as "Hoochie Coochie Man" and "I Just Want to Make Love to You," helped to define the modern Chicago blues sound. Waters' music was characterized by its raw, emotional intensity and its use of electric instruments, and he was an important influence on many other blues musicians.

a: The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was a landmark legislation signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt on June 30, 1906, marking a significant milestone in the history of consumer protection in the United States. This act was the first federal law to regulate food and drugs, and it was enacted in response to growing public concern about the safety and purity of these products. The law was principally a "truth in labeling" law, aimed at raising standards in the food and drug industries and protecting the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.

The Pure Food and Drug Act was the result of a long campaign by consumer advocates and reformers, who were motivated by the publication of Upton Sinclair's exposé "The Jungle," which highlighted the unsanitary conditions in meatpacking plants and the adulteration of food products. The law was also influenced by earlier state and local regulations, as well as legal experiments in individual states.

The Pure Food and Drug Act defined "misbranding" and "adulteration" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards. The law was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which was later renamed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930.

The Pure Food and Drug Act had several key provisions. Firstly, it required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug's packaging, and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary. Secondly, it banned foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products. Finally, it directed the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors.

The Pure Food and Drug Act was a significant achievement of the Progressive Era, and it marked the beginning of a series of consumer protection laws that were enacted by Congress in the 20th century. It has had a lasting impact on the regulation of food and drugs in the United States, and it continues to play an important role in protecting public health and safety today.
r1: Theodore Roosevelt signed the Pure Food and Drug Act that was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws . The 59th United States Congress enacted it and President Theodore Roosevelt signed it into law. The Senate passed it in February 1906 and the House in June 1906.
r2: The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was a key piece of Progressive Era legislation, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt on the same day as the Federal Meat Inspection Act. It was passed by the 59th United States Congress. It passed the Senate in February 1906 and then the House in June 1906.

a: The ophthalmic nerve exits the skull through several exit points, including the superior orbital fissure and the anterior ethmoidal foramen. The frontal branch of the ophthalmic nerve passes through the superior orbital fissure and the supraorbital notch, providing sensory innervation for the skin of the forehead and scalp. The lacrimal nerve, which is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve, passes through the orbit superiorly and innervates the lacrimal gland. Additionally, the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve gives off several sensory branches to the orbit before continuing out through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, where it enters the nasal cavity and provides innervation for much of the anterior nasal mucosa. Overall, the ophthalmic nerve plays a crucial role in providing sensory information from the eye, face, and nasal cavity to the central nervous system.
r1: The ophthalmic nerve is one of three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The frontal branch of the ophthalmic nerve exits the skull at the superior orbital fissure and supraorbital notch. The lacrimal nerve passes through the orbit superiorly when it exits the skull. The nasociliary branch goes through the nasal bones or through the anterior ethmoidal foramen.
r2: The ophthalmic nerve has three branches, the lacrimal nerve, the frontal nerve, and the nasociliary nerve.

a: The muscle fibers under the control of a single motor axon are known as a motor unit. Each motor unit is composed of a single motor neuron and all the skeletal muscle fibers it innervates. The number of muscle fibers within a motor unit can vary, with larger muscles having more fibers and smaller muscles having fewer. The size and composition of motor units are tightly controlled by developmental pathways, and they are organized differently in invertebrates and vertebrates. In vertebrates, the force of muscle contraction is controlled by the number of activated motor units, while in invertebrates, it is controlled by regulating the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals.

The central nervous system recruits motor units in a specific order, starting with the smallest units, based on Henneman's size principle. This ensures that the appropriate amount of force is generated for a given task, with slower twitch, low-force muscle fibers being activated first and faster twitch, high-force fibers being activated later. The central nervous system can control the force produced by a muscle through two distinct mechanisms: spatial recruitment, where more motor units are activated to produce a greater force, and temporal recruitment, where the frequency of muscle fiber contractions is increased.

In addition, motor pools, which consist of all individual motor neurons that innervate a single muscle, play a crucial role in controlling muscle activity. The size, composition, and anatomical location of each motor pool are tightly controlled, and they are distinguished by the different classes of motor neurons they contain. The number of motor units within a motor pool determines the activity of the muscle it innervates, with finer movements being controlled by motor pools consisting of higher numbers of individual motor neurons.

Overall, the control of muscle fibers under the control of a single motor axon is a complex process that is tightly regulated by the central nervous system and developmental pathways. The specific organization and recruitment of motor units and motor pools allow for precise control of muscle force output, enabling a wide range of movements and activities.
r1: The group of muscle fibers under the control of a single motor axon are called motor units. The type of muscle that controls a single motor axon is skeletal. The skeletal muscle can have thousands of fibers.
r2: A motor unit is made up of a motor neuron and all of the skeletal muscle fibers, also known as sarcomere innervated by the neuron's axon terminals. Groups of motor units often work together as a motor pool to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle. For example, thigh muscles can have a thousand fibers in each unit, while extraocular muscles might have ten. Muscles which possess more motor units, have greater individual motor neuron innervation, and are able to control force output more finely.

a: Manifest destiny, a phrase coined by newspaper editor John O'Sullivan in 1845, refers to the widely held belief in 19th-century America that the country was destined to expand its territory across North America. This concept was rooted in a sense of mission to redeem the Old World by setting a high example of democracy and moral values, as described by historian Frederick Merk. However, the idea was not without controversy, as many prominent Americans, including Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Whigs, rejected the notion of American imperialism and instead saw the country's moral mission as one of democratic example rather than conquest. The term was used by Democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with Mexico and the division of Oregon with the United Kingdom. Despite its contentious nature, manifest destiny remained a powerful rhetorical tool for those who believed in the inevitable expansion of the United States, and it continues to shape American history and identity to this day.
r1: Manifest destiny was a widely held cultural belief in the 19th-century United States. Newspaper editor John O'Sullivan is generally credited with coining the term "manifest destiny" in 1845. Jane Cazneau is thought to be the one who, in the annexation, coined the phrase. Manifest Destiny means the extending the area of freedom or a sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven.

a: The Great Fire of London occurred on Sunday, September 2, 1666, and lasted until Thursday, September 6, 1666. The major firefighting technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition, but this was delayed due to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday into the heart of the City, causing widespread destruction and panic. Rumors of suspicious foreigners setting fires led to violence against immigrant groups, particularly the French and Dutch. On Tuesday, the fire spread over most of the City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and threatening King Charles II's court at Whitehall. Coordinated firefighting efforts were mobilized, and the fire was eventually brought under control by the strong east winds dying down and the Tower of London garrison using gunpowder to create effective firebreaks. The social and economic problems created by the disaster were overwhelming, and evacuation from London and resettlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II. The Great Fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall, destroying 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants, and the death toll is unknown but is thought to have been small, with only six verified deaths recorded. Archaeological evidence suggests that the temperature of the fire reached melting point, and the melted piece of pottery found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, serves as a testament to the intense heat of the blaze.

a: The last person to be hanged in England was Ruth Ellis, who was executed on July 13, 1955, by famous hangman Albert Pierrepoint. The last hanging in Britain took place in 1964, when Peter Anthony Allen and Gwynne Owen Evans were executed at Walton Prison in Liverpool and Strangeways Prison in Manchester, respectively, for the murder of John Alan West. Hanging was a common method of execution in the UK and its colonies, but it was eventually abolished in 1965 for murder and in 1973 for treason. Although the death penalty remains a legally defined punishment for certain offenses, it has not been used since 1964. The last public hanging in the United States took place in 1936 in Owensboro, Kentucky.

Capital punishment in the UK has a long and complex history, with the death penalty being used for a wide range of offenses, including treason, murder, and even minor crimes such as petty theft. At its height, the "Bloody Code" included over 220 crimes punishable by death. However, in the second half of the 20th century, public opinion began to shift against capital punishment, and in 1965, it was abolished for murder. The last executions in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales took place in 1963, 1961, and 1958, respectively.

Despite attempts to restore the death penalty in the UK, it remains abolished, and the country has instead focused on alternative forms of punishment and rehabilitation. The last working gallows in the UK was dismantled in 1994, and the death penalty was finally abolished for all offenses in 1998. Today, the UK is one of the few countries in the world that has abolished the death penalty, and its history of capital punishment serves as a reminder of the ongoing debate over the effectiveness and ethics of state-sanctioned killing.
r1: Peter Anthony Allen was the last person hung in England. On August 13, 1964, Peter Allen, was hung at Walton Prison in Liverpool. Gwynne Owen Evans was hung on April 7, 1964, at Strangeways Prison in Manchester. Evans was executed for the murder of John Alan West. Allen is the last person executed in Britain.

a: The currency used in Russia is the Russian ruble (RUB), which is the oldest national currency after the Pound sterling and the world's first decimal currency. The ruble has been in use since the 13th century, and it was the currency of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The modern Russian ruble was introduced in December 1991 and replaced the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 Soviet ruble to 1 Russian ruble. The ruble is subdivided into 100 kopeks, and it is the currency of the Russian Federation, as well as the two partially recognized republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the two unrecognized republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The history of the ruble can be traced back to the 13th century, when the first coins were introduced by Prince Alexander Nevsky. In 1704, the ruble was decimalized, and it became equal to 100 kopeks. Over the years, the ruble has undergone several changes, including redenominations in 1992 and 1998. In 1992, the Soviet ruble was replaced with the Russian ruble at a rate of 1 Soviet ruble to 1 Russian ruble. In 1998, the ruble was redenominated with a new code, "RUB," and was exchanged at a rate of 1 old ruble to 1,000 new rubles.

The ruble is issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and it is available in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 rubles. The ruble is also used in the partially recognized republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the unrecognized republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The ruble is a stable currency, and it is widely traded on foreign exchange markets. It is also used as a reserve currency by several countries, including China and Vietnam.

In conclusion, the Russian ruble is the official currency of Russia and several other territories, and it has a rich history that dates back to the 13th century. It has undergone several changes over the years, including redenominations in 1992 and 1998, and it is currently a stable and widely traded currency.
r1: The Kerensky Rubles were used in Russia from the start of 1917 to October 1917. The Kerenski was the banknote or money and was replaced by the Soviet Ruble.

a: The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, as described in George Orwell's novel 1984, is a fictional book that serves as a thematic and plot element in Part 2, Chapter 9 of the novel. The book is attributed to the character Emmanuel Goldstein, who is portrayed as the principal enemy of the totalitarian state of Oceania and its leader, Big Brother. According to the novel's plot, the book is a compendium of all heresies and is circulated clandestinely among the population. The protagonist, Winston Smith, secretly hates the Party and Big Brother and believes that the book holds the key to understanding the truth about the world he lives in.

However, as Winston discovers during his torture sessions with O'Brien, a high-level member of the Inner Party, the book is not the revelatory text that he had imagined. Instead, O'Brien reveals that the book was written by a committee, including himself, as a means of propaganda to control the population. O'Brien admits that the book is accurate as a description of the Party's ideology, but he dismisses its content as nonsensical and intended to keep the population in line through fear and manipulation.

The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, therefore, serves as a powerful tool for the Party to maintain its control over the population. By creating a fictional enemy in Goldstein and a supposedly subversive text, the Party is able to justify its oppressive measures and maintain a tight grip on power. The book's significance in the novel highlights the dangers of totalitarianism and the manipulation of information to control the masses.
r1: The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism is a fictional book in George Orwell's dystopian novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four" (1949). Winston Smith, the protagonist in the book, believes the book was supposedly written by Emmanuel Goldstein and not O'Brien. O'Brien says the book was written by a committee, a committee that included himself.

a: The Paschal candle is lit in church during the Easter Vigil, which takes place on Holy Saturday night, marking the beginning of the Easter celebrations. In the United States and Southern Europe, the candle is typically around 2 inches in diameter and 36 to 48 inches tall, while in Northern Europe it is shorter in height but wider in diameter. The candle is lit with a flame from the "new fire" that is blessed during the Easter Vigil, representing the light of Christ coming into the world and dispelling the darkness of death. The Paschal candle is the first candle to be lit with this sacred flame and is the symbol of the risen Christ, representing life and light.

During the Easter Vigil, the Paschal candle is ritually immersed in the baptismal font before the remainder of the service, symbolizing the connection between baptism and the resurrection of Christ. The candle remains lit at all worship services throughout the Easter season, which is typically from Easter Saturday until Ascension Day, and is located in the sanctuary close to the altar. In some traditions, the Paschal candle is also lit during baptisms to signify the Holy Spirit and fire that John the Baptist promised to those who were baptized in Christ.

In addition to its use during the Easter season, the Paschal candle is also lit during funeral services such as the Mass of Repose and the Mass of Requiem, to signify the hope of the resurrection into which Christians are baptized. In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, there is no direct correspondence to the Western Paschal candle, but the priest carries a cross and paschal trikirion at all services during Bright Week, which consists of three lit candles in a candlestick. The deacon also carries a special Paschal candle whenever he leads an ektenia or censes.

Overall, the Paschal candle is an important symbol of the resurrection of Christ and the light of life that overcomes the darkness of death. Its liturgical use during the Easter season and other significant services throughout the year highlights the centrality of the resurrection in the Christian faith and the hope that it brings to believers.
r1: The paschal candle, a large, white candle, is lit at the opening of the Easter Vigil during Easter. The opening of the Easter Vigil is on the night of Holy Saturday and begins the Easter season. The paschal candle is lit in church and signifies the Holy Spirit during baptisms. The candle can be placed near the casket or urn during funeral services to signify hope of the resurrection, such as the Mass of Requiem or Mass or Repose.
r2: A Paschal candle is a large, white candle used in liturgies in Western Christianity. A new Paschal candle is blessed and lit every year at Easter at the opening of the Easter Vigil.

a: The concept of social distance is a crucial aspect of understanding intergroup relationships and communication. According to Bogardus (1925), social distance refers to the degree of understanding and feeling that people experience towards each other, and it can be measured through the Bogardus social distance scale. This scale assesses individuals' willingness to participate in social contacts with members of diverse social groups, such as racial and ethnic groups. The scale is a cumulative one, meaning that agreement with any item implies agreement with all preceding items. Research has shown that the extent of social distancing in the US has been decreasing slightly over time, with fewer distinctions being made among groups (Bogardus, 1946, 1956, 1966). However, the concept of social distance is not limited to geographical distance, as it also encompasses social class, race/ethnicity, gender, and sexuality.

The Social Distance Corollary, a theory in communication research, suggests that people tend to perceive others as more susceptible to media influence than they actually are (Davison, 1983). This tendency is rooted in the idea that individuals view others as being more distant or dissimilar from themselves, and therefore more likely to be influenced by external factors. This phenomenon is closely related to the third-person effect, which posits that people tend to perceive others as being more influenced by media messages than they themselves would be.

In the context of intergroup relationships, social distance can have a significant impact on communication and interaction. For instance, individuals may interact frequently with members of other groups, but still maintain a certain level of social distance due to perceived differences or lack of understanding. This can lead to a lack of trust and intimacy between groups, and can hinder effective communication and cooperation.

In conclusion, social distance is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a critical role in shaping intergroup relationships and communication. Understanding social distance and its various dimensions is essential for promoting effective communication and bridging the gap between different social groups.
r1: In sociology, social distance describes the distance between individuals or groups in society, including dimensions such as social class, race/ethnicity, gender or sexuality. Robert E. Park tried to evaluate attitude through social distance sociological theory in the 1920s. The Bogardus social distance scale is a psychological testing scale created by Emory S. Bogardus, a student of Park and tasked by him, to create a quantifiable measure of social distance. Davison tried to evaluate attitude through social distance corollary in communication.
r2: A number of people have tried evaluating attitude through social distance using different scales and theories. Emory S. Bogardus, a prominent figure in the history of American sociology who created the Bogardus social distance scale, tried evaluating attitude through the social distance scale. In communication, Davison tried to evaluate attitude through the Social Distance Corollary, a theory in communication research. In the 1920s, American sociologist Robert E.

a: The discovery of the Rh blood group system is a fascinating story that began with a misnomer, but has since become a crucial aspect of blood transfusion medicine. In 1937, Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener discovered the Rh blood group system, which they believed to be a similar antigen found in rhesus monkey red blood cells. However, it was later discovered that the human factor was not identical to the rhesus monkey factor, yet the term "Rh" survived and is still used today. The significance of the discovery was not immediately apparent and was only realized in 1940, after subsequent findings by Philip Levine and Rufus Stetson.

The Rh blood group system is one of the most important blood group systems, second only to the ABO blood group system. It consists of 49 defined blood group antigens, with the five antigens D, C, c, E, and e being the most important. The Rh(D) status of an individual is typically described as "positive" or "negative," and the terms "Rh factor," "Rh positive," and "Rh negative" all refer to the Rh(D) antigen only. Antibodies to Rh antigens can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions, while antibodies to the Rh(D) and Rh(c) antigens can cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.

The ABO blood group system, discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, is the most important blood type classification system in human blood transfusions. It is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes. A mismatch in this or any other serotype can cause a serious, potentially fatal, adverse reaction after a transfusion, or a contra-indicated immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types are also present in some other animals, such as rodents and apes.

In conclusion, the discovery of the Rh blood group system and the ABO blood group system have revolutionized the field of blood transfusion medicine, allowing for safe and compatible blood transfusions. The terms "Rh" and "ABO" are now widely used in the medical field to denote the different blood types and have become an essential aspect of blood transfusion medicine.
r1: Karl Landsteiner figured out a way to determine the ABO type of blood in 1931. Landsteiner received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. The rhesus factor type of blood was discovered by 1937 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener. The term “Rh”, a human blood group system, was originally an abbreviation of "Rhesus factor" and believed by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener to be a similar antigen found in rhesus monkey red blood cells.

a: France joined the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778, after the signing of the Treaty of Alliance, which was a pivotal moment in the war. Prior to this, France had been secretly supplying the Continental Army with supplies and money since 1775, motivated by a desire for revenge against Britain, who had defeated them in the Seven Years' War, as well as a desire to weaken their perennial enemy. The French public and aristocracy were also inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment and saw the American Revolution as an opportunity to support the cause of liberty and republicanism.

The French entry into the war marked a significant turning point, as it led to further escalation of the conflict and the involvement of other European powers. Spain, who had also been secretly supplying the colonists, entered the war as France's ally after the signing of the Treaty of Aranjuez in 1779. The Dutch Republic also entered the war on the side of the colonists in 1780, after Britain declared war on them.

French support was crucial to the colonists' success, as they provided vital supplies of arms, ammunition, and uniforms to the Continental Army. Additionally, French actions in the West Indies and elsewhere forced Britain to redeploy troops and naval units away from the North American colonies, weakening their hold on the region.

Overall, France's involvement in the American Revolution was a significant factor in the colonists' ultimate victory against Britain. However, it came at a cost, as France accumulated over 1 billion livres in debt as a result of its participation in the war. Despite this, the French involvement in the American Revolution marked a significant moment in the history of both nations, solidifying a lasting bond between the two countries and cementing their shared commitment to the principles of liberty and democracy.
r1: France’s involvement in the American Revolutionary War began in June 1775 by them starting to secretly ship supplies to the colonists. In the spring of 1776, they started sending military aid through a company called Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie. On March 17, 1778, four days after a French ambassador informed the British government that France had officially recognized the United States as an independent nation with the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and the Treaty of Alliance, Great Britain declared war on them.
r2: French involvement in the American Revolutionary War of 1775-1783 began in 1775, when France secretly shipped supplies to the Continental Army established in June 1775.

a: The creation of the United States Senate was based on the British system of governance and was intended to provide a more deliberative and less populist counterbalance to the House of Representatives. The Senate was established by the United States Constitution and was designed to represent the interests of the states, with each state having two senators regardless of its population. This was a departure from the House of Representatives, which was based on population. The Senate was intended to provide a more stable and less reactive body than the House, with members serving six-year terms instead of two-year terms. This was intended to allow the Senate to act with more "coolness, with more system, and with more wisdom" and to "restrain, if possible, the fury of democracy." The Senate was also intended to give states with smaller populations equal standing with larger states in the legislative process.

The idea of a bicameral legislature was not universally popular at the Constitutional Convention, and the apportionment scheme of the Senate was a subject of controversy. However, the Founding Fathers, such as Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, admired the British system of governance and saw the Senate as an American version of the House of Lords. They believed that the Senate would provide a more stable and effective check on the popular passions of the House of Representatives and would help to ensure that the interests of the states were represented in the legislative process.

Over time, the Senate has developed its own unique powers and responsibilities, such as the power of advice and consent on presidential appointments and the authority to conduct trials of impeachment. These powers have helped to further distinguish the Senate from the House of Representatives and have reinforced the idea that the Senate is a more deliberative and less populist body. Despite its origins in the British system of governance, the Senate has evolved into a distinctly American institution with its own unique role and responsibilities in the legislative process.
r1: The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress that is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. The creation of the US senate was named after the ancient body of the Roman Senate in ancient Rome. The creation of the US senate was based on the House of Peers or Lords, a British entity or government. The House of Lords was admired by the Founding Fathers of the United States for its system of governance. The desire for its creation was to have equal apportionment and the equal distribution of the states.
r2: The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which along with the United States House of Representatives—the lower chamber—comprises the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States. The U.S. Senate, named after the ancient Roman Senate, was designed as a more deliberative body than the U.S. House. Despite their past grievances with specific ruling British governments, many among the Founding Fathers had retained a great admiration for the British system of governance. In general, they viewed the Senate to be an American version of House of Lords. The Senate was also intended to give states with smaller populations equal standing with larger states, which is equal apportionment.

a: The origins of "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" by the Buckwheat Boyz can be traced back to the early 2000s, when the group was formed by Marcus Bowens and Jermaine Fuller. The group was signed to Koch Records and released their self-titled album, which featured the hit single "Peanut Butter Jelly Time." The song became popular on the internet after a flash music video featuring an animated dancing banana was created. The video was widely shared and the song gained even more exposure when it was featured on popular TV shows such as "The Proud Family," "Family Guy," and "Regular Show."

Tragically, the group's success was cut short when founding member Jermaine Fuller died during an 11-hour police standoff in 2002. His death led to the disbandment of the group, and their music was largely forgotten.

a: The Immorality Act, originally enacted in 1957 as the Sexual Offences Act, was repealed in South Africa in 1985 and 1988. The act was infamous for prohibiting sex between people of different races, until this provision was removed in 1985 as part of the repeal of many petty apartheid laws under the government of P. W. Botha. The act also prohibited other sex offences, including sex with children under the age of consent and sex with the mentally incompetent.

In 1969, the Immorality Act was amended to introduce or expand several offences, including the prohibition of sex toys and the criminalization of sexual activity between men under the age of 19. The act also introduced a clause known as the "three men at a party" provision, which prohibited any sexual activity between men at a party where more than two people were present.

In 1988, the Immorality Amendment Act renamed the Immorality Act as the Sexual Offences Act, and deleted the definitions of "coloured" and "white" within the act, as well as the provision that barred interracial, extramarital sex. These changes effectively repealed the provisions of the 1957 act that prohibited interracial sex, and marked a significant step towards the decriminalization of same-sex relationships in South Africa.

Overall, the repeal of the Immorality Act in 1985 and 1988 represented a significant shift in South Africa's approach to sexual offences and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. While the act was originally enacted to enforce apartheid-era laws that prohibited interracial relationships, its repeal marked a move towards a more inclusive and equitable society, where all individuals are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
r1: The Immorality Act was the title of two acts of the Parliament of South Africa which prohibited, among other things, sexual relations between white people and people of other races. The Immorality Act of 1927 and the Immorality Act of 1950 was repealed in South Africa on 12 April 1957. The Immorality Act of 1957 was first partially repealed in 1985 and then a second time in 1988. The third and last time the act was repealed was on 16 December 2007.
r2: Immorality Act was the title of two acts of the Parliament of South Africa which prohibited, amongst other things, sexual relations between white people and people of other races. The first Immorality Act, of 1927, prohibited sex between whites and blacks, until amended in 1950 to prohibit sex between whites and all non-whites. The act was repealed on 12 April 1957 by the Immorality Act, 1957, section 16 of which contained a similar prohibition of sex between whites and non-whites. The prohibition was finally lifted by the Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985. The Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 renamed the act from "Immorality Act, 1957" to "Sexual Offences Act, 1957". The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, enacted on 16 December 2007, repealed and replaced many provisions, leaving only those related to prostitution and brothel-keeping.

a: Based on the given factoids, it is clear that the person who set the fire in One Tree Hill is not explicitly stated in the text. However, we can infer that it was either Nathan Scott or Lucas Scott, as they are the two main characters involved in the conflict with their father, Dan Scott.

The fact that Nathan and Lucas have a strained relationship with their father, Dan, and that they have been investigating him for his illegal dealings, suggests that they may have had a motive to set the fire. Additionally, the fact that Dan has been using his sons for his own gain and has hurt them emotionally and physically in the past, could have driven them to seek revenge.

Furthermore, the dream that Nathan has, in which he sees what life would have been like if his mother had married Karen instead of Deb, suggests that he has been grappling with feelings of resentment and anger towards his father for the choices he made. This could have led him to seek revenge by setting the fire.

On the other hand, Lucas's desire to avenge all of Dan's victims, including his mother, Deb, and his uncle, Keith, could also have motivated him to set the fire. His discovery of Dan's illegal dealings and his plan to expose him could have led to a confrontation that resulted in the fire.

In conclusion, while it is not explicitly stated who set the fire in One Tree Hill, the factoids suggest that it was either Nathan or Lucas, driven by their desire for revenge against their father, Dan, for the pain and hurt he has caused them.
r1: In the second season of One Tree Hill, actress Barbara Alyn Woods who played Deborah "Deb" Lee, previously Deb Scott, set fire to one tree hill. It was thought to be Keith, Dan Scott’s older brother, but filled with guilt, she admits it to Dan after he killed Keith.

a: The Statue of Liberty was delivered to the United States on June 17, 1885, when it arrived in New York Harbor after being shipped from France. However, the statue was not fully assembled and erected on Bedloe's Island (now Liberty Island) until October 28, 1886. The delivery of the statue was the culmination of a long and challenging process that began in the early 1870s, when French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and American publisher Joseph Pulitzer launched a fundraising campaign to build the monument. Due to post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until 1875, and it was not until 1884 that the French government agreed to provide funding for the pedestal. The American committee, led by Pulitzer, struggled to raise funds, and by 1885, work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Pulitzer's drive for donations, which included a public campaign and a newspaper drive, attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar.

The statue was built in France and shipped to the United States in crates, where it was assembled on the completed pedestal. The completion of the statue was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland. The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933, it has been maintained by the National Park Service. Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred for safety since 1916.

The Statue of Liberty has become an iconic symbol of freedom and a national park tourism destination, welcoming immigrants arriving from abroad and representing the ideals of liberty and democracy. The statue's delivery to the United States in 1885 marked a significant milestone in the history of American-French relations and the development of the United States as a symbol of freedom and opportunity for people around the world.
r1: The colossal neoclassic sculpture named the Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island in the New York Harbor and was a gift from the people of France. Lady Liberty was delivered in parts by ships that crossed the Atlantic Ocean. The arm was delivered in August 1876 so it could be displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 and the rest of her was fully delivered in 1885.
r2: While the majority of the Statue of Liberty was delivered to the United States in 1885, the statue's arm was delivered to the US in August 1876. The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882.

a: In 1913, Francis Ouimet beat a field of professional golfers, including British champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, to win the U.S. Open at the age of 20. This historic victory not only marked the first time an American amateur had won the tournament, but it also had a profound impact on the sport of golf itself. Prior to Ouimet's win, amateur golf was considered a privilege reserved for the wealthy, while professional golf provided a means of income for former caddies. However, Ouimet's victory challenged these social norms and paved the way for the democratization of golf.

Ouimet's journey to the U.S. Open began at a young age, when he taught himself to play golf using clubs from his brother and balls he found around the course. His natural talent and dedication quickly caught the attention of country club members and caddie master Dan MacNamara, who helped him hone his skills. Despite his father's insistence that he drop out of school and pursue a more "useful" career, Ouimet's passion for golf prevailed, and he went on to win numerous amateur titles, including the Massachusetts Amateur five times.

When Ouimet was invited to participate in the 1913 U.S. Open, he was still a teenager and had never competed against professional golfers before. However, he was determined to prove himself and accepted the challenge. Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ouimet performed incredibly well and went on to win the tournament by five strokes, defeating both Vardon and Ray in the process.

Ouimet's victory had a significant impact on the sport of golf, as it helped to popularize the game and pave the way for its democratization. In the years following his win, the number of American players tripled, and numerous public courses were built, including the first public course in The Bronx borough of New York City. Ouimet's success also inspired a new generation of golfers, including his own son, who went on to become a successful golfer in his own right.

Despite his groundbreaking victory, Ouimet never turned professional and instead chose to remain an amateur for his entire career. However, his decision to use his celebrity to aid his own sporting goods business led to controversy and ultimately resulted in the USGA stripping him of his amateur status in 1916. Nevertheless, Ouimet's legacy as a pioneering figure in American golf remains unquestioned, and his impact on the sport continues to be felt to this day.
r1: Francis Ouimet was an American amateur golfer who is frequently referred to as the "father of amateur golf" in the United States.

a: The first bottle of champagne was made in 1662 in England, as recorded in the Royal Society. However, the process of creating champagne as we know it today was not well understood at the time, and it was considered a "devil's wine" due to the frequent explosions and popping of bottles in the cellar. The development of champagne production was a gradual process that involved the use of acid, lasers, or glass etching tools to provide nucleation sites for continuous bubble formation. This method was later adopted in France, where champagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers of champagne made efforts to associate their products with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to popularity among the emerging middle class. Despite the risks of explosions and injuries, champagne production continued to increase in the early 18th century, and the drink became a staple of luxury and celebration. Today, champagne is produced exclusively in the Champagne region of France and is subject to strict appellation rules, including the use of specific grapes, vineyard practices, and pressing regimes.
r1: Champagne is a sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France. In 1662, the method for making the first champagne was created. The first bottle of champagne was bottled in 1663.

a: The Memphis Belle was not the first B-17 to complete 25 missions. According to the information provided in the factoids, the B-17 "Hell's Angels" of the 303rd Bomb Group completed 25 combat missions on May 13, 1943, one week before the Memphis Belle. The Memphis Belle, piloted by Robert K. Morgan, completed 25 missions on May 21, 1943. While the Memphis Belle was the first B-17 to complete 25 missions and return to the United States, it was not the first to complete 25 missions overall. The 303rd Bomb Group, which the Memphis Belle was a part of, flew a total of 364 missions during the war, more than any other Eighth Air Force B-17 group, and one of its other Forts, "Knock Out Dropper," was the first to complete 50 and 75 missions.

The Memphis Belle and its crew were notable not only for their completion of 25 missions but also for their bravery and skill in flying through dangerous conditions. During one mission, the aircraft was hit by flak and lost two engines, causing the Fort to drop behind the formation. Despite the injuries sustained by the radio operator-gunner, Technical Sergeant Forrest L. Vosler, the crew was able to repair the radio and make emergency transmissions. When the B-17 ditched, Vosler assisted the badly wounded tail gunner until he could be loaded into one of the plane's dinghies. The Memphis Belle's crew and their accomplishments became a symbol of the bravery and sacrifice of the American military during World War II.
r1: The first B-17 was not the Memphis Belle, a Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress, to complete 25 missions.

a: The movie "Summer of '42" was filmed in various locations in Mendocino, California, on the West Coast of the United States, as well as on Nantucket Island, off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The film's director, Robert Mulligan, chose Mendocino as the primary filming location due to its scenic coastal setting and its resemblance to the early 1940s era in which the story is set. However, some scenes were also filmed on Nantucket Island, where the story is set and where the real-life events that inspired the film took place.

The film's production team chose to shoot on location in Mendocino and Nantucket to capture the authentic atmosphere and setting of the story. The film's script was written by Herman Raucher, who based the story on his own memories of his summer vacation on Nantucket Island in 1942, when he was just 14 years old. The film's cast includes Gary Grimes, Jerry Houser, Oliver Conant, Jennifer O'Neill, and Katherine Allentuck, among others.

The film's production was relatively smooth, with the cast and crew working together to bring the story to life. However, the film's studio, Warner Bros., was initially hesitant about the film's potential success, and they only agreed to produce it on the condition that Raucher write a book based on the script. The book became a national bestseller, which helped to build interest in the film and ultimately led to its success.

Overall, the film's locations and production design were carefully chosen to capture the essence of the story and its setting, and the cast and crew worked together to bring the story to life on the big screen. The film's success, both critically and commercially, is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all involved in its production.

Nantucket Island was too far modernized in 1970 to be convincingly transformed to resemble an early 1940s resort, so production was taken to Mendocino, California, on the West Coast of the US.

a: The Pilgrims originally planned to land in the area explored by Hudson, specifically in the mouth of the Hudson River near Manhattan, which was part of the Colony of Virginia at the time. However, due to the London Company's intent to claim the area before the Dutch could establish themselves, and the new grant obtained by the Plymouth Council for New England, the Pilgrims were forced to change their plans and settle in Cape Cod, Massachusetts instead. Despite the challenges they faced, including the harsh winter and the lack of suitable shelter, the Pilgrims were able to establish a settlement in Plymouth Colony with the help of Native Americans, and their experience laid the foundation for American democracy. The "Mayflower Compact," signed before disembarking, emphasized the importance of majority rule and self-government, and the settlement's success depended on the assistance of the local Wampanoag tribe, who taught the Pilgrims indigenous methods for cultivating corn. The Pilgrims' original plan to settle in the Hudson River area was thwarted by the London Company's actions, but their ultimate settlement in Cape Cod Bay led to the establishment of Plymouth Colony and the development of American democracy.
r1: The Pilgrims, which were English settlers, originally planned to land in Northern Virginia in the Hudson River. Before the land grant, they wanted to settle in Virginia, but they went north after they obtained a land grant in New England.

a: The question of when the Queen of England became queen is a complex one, as it depends on how one defines the term "Queen of England." If we consider the Acts of Union in 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain and ended the independence of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, then the Queen of England ceased to exist as a separate political entity. However, if we look at the line of succession before the Acts of Union, then the Queen of England was Elizabeth I, who ascended to the throne in 1558.

Elizabeth I was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. She was born on 24 May 1533 and was the last of the Tudor dynasty. Her reign is known for the Elizabethan era, a time of cultural and artistic flourishing, and for her strategic political maneuvering to maintain peace and stability in England.

However, her succession was not without challenges. Her half-sister, Mary, was a Catholic and had a claim to the throne. Additionally, Mary, Queen of Scots, who was the granddaughter of Margaret Tudor, Henry VIII's sister, also had a claim to the throne. Elizabeth I was a Protestant and her religious beliefs were not universally accepted in England, which made her succession uncertain.

In 1558, when Mary I died without an heir, Elizabeth I succeeded to the throne. She was crowned on 25 January 1559 and reigned until her death on 24 March 1603. During her reign, she navigated the complex religious and political landscape of Europe, avoiding the religious conflicts that plagued other countries and maintaining England's independence.

a: There are five courts of appeals in Georgia. Prior to 1967, all criminal cases in Georgia had to be heard in one division of the court, but this requirement was repealed that year. In 1996, a bill was proposed to increase the size of the court to thirteen judges, but it failed, although the Legislature did approve a bill to add a tenth judge. The court was increased to twelve judges in 1999 when Governor Roy Barnes signed a bill. Currently, the court has fifteen members who serve in five divisions.

The Georgia Court of Appeals has a limited appellate jurisdiction compared to many other state appellate courts. It may hear appeals in all cases that do not involve Georgia statutes, and it may also hear appeals in certain cases where reversible error appears to exist or where establishment of a precedent is desirable. Additionally, certain rulings made by the trial court may be appealable even if the case is still ongoing.

The genesis of the Georgia Court of Appeals can be traced back to a report by the State Bar of Georgia in 1895, which suggested that the Georgia State Legislature create an intermediate appellate court to relieve the Georgia Supreme Court of its rapidly growing caseload. The Legislature declined to create a new appellate court, instead increasing the size of the Supreme Court. It wasn't until 1906 that the Legislature approved an amendment to the Georgia state constitution to create a three-judge court of appeals, which was approved by voters. The first election of judges took place in 1906, and Arthur G. Powell, Richard Russell, Sr., and Benjamin H. Hill were the first judges elected to the court. Hill was the first chief judge of the court.

Overall, the Georgia Court of Appeals has a rich history and plays an important role in the state's judicial system, providing a forum for the review of certain appeals and helping to alleviate the workload of the Georgia Supreme Court.
r1: The Georgia Court of Appeals is the intermediate-level appellate court for the U.S. state of Georgia. The Legislature increased the size of the court to seven judges in 1960, and then to nine judges in three divisions in 1961.

The bill failed, but the Legislature did approve another act to add a tenth judge. The court grew again in 1999 when Governor Roy Barnes signed a bill which increased the number of judges to twelve. The court now has 15 members, who serve in five divisions.

a: The oldest company in the Dow Jones index is General Electric (GE), which was added to the index in 1907 and remained a component until 2018. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly owned companies in the United States, and it has a rich history dating back to 1896. The index was created by Charles Dow, who also founded Dow Jones & Company and The Wall Street Journal. The DJIA is calculated using a price-weighted average, which means that the value of the index is influenced by the price of each component stock, rather than their market capitalization.

Over the years, the composition of the DJIA has changed several times, with companies being added and removed based on their performance and market relevance. For example, in 1884, Charles Dow composed his first stock average, which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies. Since then, the index has undergone several changes, including the removal of companies such as the Central Pacific Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey.

One of the most significant events in the history of the DJIA was the breakup of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1911, which was ordered by the Supreme Court due to antitrust violations. The breakup led to the creation of several new companies, including Conoco, Amoco, Chevron, Exxon, and Mobil. These companies have since become some of the largest and most influential players in the oil and gas industry.

Despite the changes in the composition of the DJIA over the years, General Electric has remained a constant presence in the index since its addition in 1907. However, in 2018, GE was removed from the index and replaced by Apple, reflecting the changing nature of the economy and the evolving needs of investors.

In conclusion, the oldest company in the Dow Jones index is General Electric, which was added to the index in 1907 and remained a component until 2018. The DJIA has a rich history dating back to 1896 and has undergone several changes over the years, reflecting the evolution of the economy and the needs of investors.
r1: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States, with its first calculations taking place in 1896. As of April 2, 2019, the components of the DJIA have changed 53 times since its beginning on May 26, 1896. General Electric had the longest continuous presence on the index, beginning in 1907 and ending in 2018. The oldest company currently in the DJIA is ExxonMobil.
r2: While General Electric was the oldest company with the longest continuous presence in the index, ExxonMobil is the oldest company currently in the Dow Jones index, also known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or DJIA.

a: The lines parallel to the equator are called circles of latitude. These circles are abstract east-west circles that connect all locations on Earth at a given latitude, disregarding elevation. The equator itself is the longest circle of latitude and the only one that is also a great circle. The other circles of latitude, which are perpendicular to all meridians, are named after their distance from the equator, such as the 30th parallel north or south. The latitude of each circle of latitude is approximately the angle between the equator and the circle, with the angle's vertex at Earth's center. The equator is at 0° latitude, and the North and South Poles are at 90° north and south, respectively. The circles of latitude are unlike circles of longitude, which are all great circles that pass through the center of the Earth, and their length can be calculated using a common sine or cosine function. The 60th parallel north or south, for example, is half as long as the Equator, disregarding Earth's minor flattening.
r1: A circle of latitude or line of latitude on Earth is an abstract east–west small circle connecting all locations around Earth. The general lines parallel to the equator are called latitude or parallels. The four major lines parallel to the equator are called the Arctic Circle, the Tropic of Cancer, the Tropic of Capricorn, and the Antarctic Circle.
r2: Lines of latitude are the general lines parallel to the equator. Lines of longitude are the general lines that run north to south and are parallel to the prime meridian.

a: The three-point line, a staple of modern basketball, has a rich and varied history that spans over six decades. The first experimentation with the three-point line took place in the collegiate level in 1945, with a 21-foot line, but it was not adopted as a rule. It wasn't until the American Basketball League (ABL) instituted the rule in 1961 that the three-point line began to gain traction. The ABL's three-point line was a radius of 25 feet from the basket, except along the sides. The Eastern Professional Basketball League followed suit in its 1963-64 season. The three-point shot gained popularity in the American Basketball Association (ABA) in the 1970s, where it was used as a marketing tool to compete with the NBA. In 1979, the NBA adopted the three-point line for a one-year trial, and it became a permanent fixture in the league in 1980.

The introduction of the three-point line in the NBA had a significant impact on the game, as it opened up the offense and created new scoring opportunities. The line was initially set at 23 feet, 9 inches, but was later moved to its current distance of 22 feet, 1.75 inches in 1994. The NBA also experimented with a shorter distance in the 1990s, but ultimately returned to the original distance. The three-point line has since become an integral part of the game, and players like Ray Allen have become all-time leaders in career made three-pointers.

The three-point line has not only changed the game of basketball at the professional level, but it has also had a ripple effect on collegiate and high school basketball. The NCAA first adopted the three-point line in the 1986-87 season, and it has since become a standard feature of the game at all levels. The line has also been adopted in international competitions, such as the Olympic Games, where it made its debut in 1988.

In conclusion, the three-point line has a rich history that spans over six decades, and it has had a profound impact on the game of basketball. From its humble beginnings in the collegiate level to its widespread adoption in professional and collegiate basketball, the three-point line has changed the game and created new scoring opportunities for players.

a: In May 2017, principal photography for "The Post" began in New York City, with Steven Spielberg directing and producing the film, and Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks starring as Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee, respectively. Spielberg had previously halted production on "The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara" due to a casting setback, and was drawn to "The Post" because of its timely and relevant story. The film is based on the true story of the Washington Post's publication of the Pentagon Papers, classified documents detailing the US government's involvement in the Vietnam War. Spielberg was attracted to the script, written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, because it was a story that needed to be told immediately, and he began working on the film shortly after reading the first draft.

a: The Kim family came to power in North Korea in 1948, following the end of Japanese colonial rule over the peninsula. Kim Il-sung, the founder of the Kim dynasty, began his rule with the support of the Soviet Union, and quickly established a cult of personality and a state philosophy of "Juche" that would be passed down to his successors. Despite the country's socialist ideology, the Kim family's governance has been comparable to a royal family, with little publicly known about the family's personal lives or inner workings. The Kim dynasty has maintained power for three generations, with Kim Il-sung's son Kim Jong-il and grandson Kim Jong-un succeeding him as leaders of the country.

The primary three known Old English poets are Cædmon, Aldhelm, and Cynewulf, with Cædmon's "Hymn" being the oldest extant poem in English, composed in the 7th century. The literature of this period consists of sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, Anglo-Saxon chronicles and narrative history works, laws, wills, and other legal works, and poetry. The most famous work of Old English literature is the epic poem "Beowulf", which is often considered the beginning of the traditional canon of English literature. Other notable works include the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" and the poem "The Grave", which presents a transitional text between Old and Middle English. In total, there are over 400 surviving manuscripts from this period, with about 189 considered "major". Besides Old English literature, the Anglo-Saxons also wrote a number of Anglo-Latin works.

a: The second sound of the heartbeat, also known as the S2 sound, is produced by the closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary valves) at the end of ventricular systole and the beginning of ventricular diastole. This sound is typically heard as a split second sound, with the A sound (the first heart sound) occurring before the P sound (the second heart sound). The S2 sound is caused by the sudden block of flow reversal as the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery falls below the pressure in the left and right ventricles, respectively. This blockage causes the blood to flow back through the valves, creating a reverberation that produces the S2 sound.

In a healthy adult, the S2 sound is normally heard as a single, high-pitched sound that is split into two components: the early (E) component and the late (A) component. The early component is produced by the closure of the pulmonary valve, while the late component is produced by the closure of the aortic valve. The split S2 sound is typically heard during inspiration, as the decrease in intrathoracic pressure increases the time needed for pulmonary pressure to exceed that of the right ventricular pressure.

However, a widely split S2 sound can be associated with several cardiovascular conditions, including left bundle branch block, pulmonary stenosis, and atrial septal defect. Additionally, the presence of extra heart sounds, such as gallop rhythms, can also be indicative of certain cardiac conditions. These sounds can be heard in both normal and abnormal situations, and their presence and characteristics can provide important diagnostic information for cardiologists and other healthcare professionals.
r1: The sound or noises that your heart makes is turbulence created when the heart valves snap shut. The first heart sound, or S1, forms the "lub" of "lub-dub" and is composed of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). The second heart sound, or S, forms the "dub" of "lub-dub" and is composed of components A (aortic valve closure) and P (pulmonary valve closure). The earlier component of the second sound is the A2 and the later component is P2. The acoustical phenomenon within blood that is associated with the second sound of the heartbeat is called reverberation or reverb.
r2: The second heart sound follows the first, but the cause of each is different. The first heart sound occurs when the atrioventricular valves close at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole, while the second heart sound occurs when the aortic valve and pulmonary valve close at the end of ventricular systole and the beginning of ventricular diastole. The second heart sound consists of aortic valve closure followed by pulmonary valve closure and is also associated with the acoustical phenomenon within blood called reverberation.

The team has a rich history, with notable achievements including winning the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947 and their third championship in 1975, which is considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.

In their early years in San Francisco, the Warriors were led by Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Rick Barry, who helped the team return to being title contenders. However, the team experienced periods of struggle in the 1980s and 2000s, before becoming playoff regulars towards the end of the 20th century with the rise of stars such as Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, colloquially referred to as "Run TMC." Despite failing to capture a championship during this period, the team has continued to be a competitive force in the league, with recent success including winning the NBA championship in 2015 and 2017.

Today, the Warriors play their home games at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, and have a loyal fan base throughout the Bay Area. The team's history and achievements are celebrated by fans, including the legacy of Wilt Chamberlain, who holds the single-game scoring record with 100 points against the New York Knicks in 1962, and the team's 1975 championship victory, which is considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. Overall, the Golden State Warriors have a rich history and a dedicated fan base, and continue to be a competitive force in the NBA.

a: The artwork for Pink Floyd's album "The Wall" was created by cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, who had previously worked with the band on their "In the Flesh" tour. Scarfe's distinctive style and ability to bring the album's themes of isolation and disillusionment to life made him the perfect choice for the project. The album's cover features a sticker or printed lettering of the artist name and album title, with the eponymous wall in various stages of construction, accompanied by characters from the story. Scarfe also created the inside sleeve art and labels of both vinyl records, which showcase his signature style and further bring the album's themes to life.

The artwork for "The Wall" is particularly notable for its use of animation, which was translated into dolls for the band's "The Wall" tour and later into Scarfe's animated segments for the film based on the album. The use of animation not only adds a unique visual element to the album but also helps to further emphasize the album's themes of disillusionment and the breakdown of society.

The creation of the artwork for "The Wall" was not without its challenges, however. According to the wikipage, the album's release was initially met with indifference from some executives at Columbia Records, who were reportedly unimpressed by what they heard. Additionally, the band's bassist and songwriter Roger Waters had to negotiate with the label to secure smaller publishing rights, which he eventually did. Despite these challenges, the artwork for "The Wall" has become iconic and is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive and memorable album covers of all time.
r1: The album cover for the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd was by Gerald Scarfe. Peter Biziou did the cinematography for the 1982 film also by the same name.

a: The architect of the north and south blocks of the Central Secretariat in Delhi is a combination of two famous architects, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. Lutyens was responsible for the design of the Viceroy's House, now known as Rashtrapati Bhavan, while Baker designed the Secretariat buildings. The two architects worked together on the project, with Lutyens serving as the lead architect and Baker as the second in command. The construction of the Secretariat began in the 1910s, during the British colonial era, and was completed in the 1920s.

The Secretariat buildings are designed in a classical architectural style, with a blend of Mughal and Rajasthani motifs. The buildings are made of cream and red Dholpur sandstone from Rajasthan, with the red sandstone forming the base. The buildings are topped by giant domes and have broad corridors and wide stairways to the four floors. The use of "Jali", perforated screens, is a distinct feature of the building, providing shade from the hot Indian sun and monsoon rains. The "Chatri" structure, a unique design to India, is also incorporated in the building, providing relief to travelers.

The four "dominion columns" located in front of the main gates of the buildings were given by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, symbolizing the British dominion. However, India became independent in the next 17 years, and the Secretariat became the seat of power of a sovereign India. As the building ran out of accommodation, several extensions were made to the original structure.

The Central Secretariat metro station is a Delhi Metro station located near the Secretariat buildings, providing a same-level interchange between the Yellow and Violet lines. The station is situated near several landmarks, including the Parliament House and the Krishi Bhavan. The Secretariat Building is currently home to some of the most important ministries of the Cabinet of India, and is an important symbol of the Indian government.
r1: The term or phrase Central Secretariat is used for the name of where the Cabinet Secretariat is housed, which administers the Government of India and a building in Delhi Metro station in Delhi, India. The north and south block of the Secretariat Building in New Delhi was designed by the prominent British architect Herbert Baker in Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. The architect of north and south blocks of Central Secretariat in Delhi was Kumagai-Skanska-HCC-Itochu Joint Venture (KSHI-JV).

a: The first cassette tape was introduced by Philips in 1962, revolutionizing the way people listened to music and recorded audio. The Compact Cassette, as it was called, was a significant improvement over earlier magnetic tape formats, such as the reel-to-reel tapes and the Stereo 8-track cartridge. The cassette tape was more user-friendly, convenient, and portable, making it a popular choice for both personal and professional use.

The development of the cassette tape was a result of a race between Philips and other companies, such as Telefunken and Grundig, to establish a standard format for magnetic tape recording. Philips' decision to license the format free of charge helped the Compact Cassette become the dominant format, and it quickly gained popularity in the market. The first cassette player was introduced in 1968, and by the early 1970s, the cassette tape had become one of the two most common formats for prerecorded music, alongside the LP record.

The cassette tape's success can be attributed to its convenience and portability. Unlike reel-to-reel tapes, the cassette tape did not require the user to handle unruly tape ends or thread the tape through the machine before use. The tape was contained within a protective plastic shell, making it easy to handle and store. Additionally, the cassette tape's reversible design allowed for both sides to be played, and some models even had an auto-reverse mechanism that allowed the tape to run continuously.

The cassette tape's popularity peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, with the rise of portable cassette players and boomboxes. However, with the advent of digital technology and the introduction of the compact disc (CD), the cassette tape's popularity began to decline. Today, the cassette tape has largely been replaced by digital formats such as MP3s and streaming services, but it remains a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era in music and audio technology.
r1: The first compact cassette or musicassette (MC) tape was invented on 30 August 1963, and it was introduced in Europe in September 1963. It was not introduced in the United States until November 1964 though. The first large cassette tape, which failed, came out in 1958 after four years of development.
r2: The first compact cassette came out in Europe and the US on different dates and was preceded in 1958 by RCA Victor's release of the first large cassette that failed. The first compact cassette tape was invented in 1962 by Philips. It was introduced in Europe on 30 August 1963 at the Berlin Radio Show and to the United States under the Norelco brand in November 1964.

a: The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final was a highly anticipated rematch between the United States and Japan, two powerhouse teams in women's football. The stakes were high, with the United States looking to become the first team to win three Women's World Cup titles and Japan aiming to become the first team to successfully defend their title. The final was played at BC Place in Vancouver, Canada, on July 5, 2015.

The United States entered the final as two-time champions, having won the inaugural tournament in 1991 and the 1999 edition. They were undefeated in the tournament and had only conceded one goal in the six matches leading up to the final. Japan, on the other hand, was making its second consecutive appearance in the final and was looking to become the first team to successfully defend their title since Germany in 2007.

The two teams had a rich history of meetings in major tournaments, with the United States winning three of their previous four encounters, including the 2011 World Cup final. However, Japan had won their last meeting in the 2014 Algarve Cup, a 0-0 draw.

The final was a highly competitive and intense match, with both teams creating scoring opportunities throughout the game. The United States struck first in the 14th minute through a header by midfielder Lauren Holiday, who found the back of the net with a deft flick-on from a corner kick. Japan equalized in the 62nd minute through a stunning free kick by midfielder Aya Miyama, who curled the ball into the top left corner of the goal.

However, the United States regained the lead in the 69th minute through a header by forward Abby Wambach, who rose above the Japanese defense to meet a cross from the right flank. The United States added two more goals in the final 10 minutes of the game, through a strike by forward Alex Morgan in the 78th minute and a penalty kick by midfielder Carli Lloyd in the 84th minute. Lloyd's penalty was awarded after a controversial handball call against Japan, which was disputed by the Japanese players and coaches.

The final score was 5-2 in favor of the United States, who won their third Women's World Cup title and became the first team to win three championships. The victory was sweet revenge for the United States, who had lost to Japan in the 2011 final. The tournament was a huge success, with record attendances and viewership figures, and it helped to further boost the profile of women's football around the world.

a: The ratio of the wave height to its wave length is called the wave steepness, and it is a fundamental parameter in the study of ocean waves. According to Stokes' third-order theory, the wave steepness is directly proportional to the non-linearity of the waves, as measured by the expansion parameter "ka". Specifically, the wave steepness is given by the ratio of the wave height "H" to the wave length "λ", and it is defined as the ratio of the wave height to the wave length.

In deep water, the wave steepness is determined by the balance between the gravitational force acting on the water and the viscous forces resisting the motion of the water. As the wave amplitude increases, the wave steepness also increases, and the waves become more non-linear. This is because the viscous forces resisting the motion of the water become less significant as the wave amplitude increases, allowing the waves to grow in amplitude and steepness.

The Stokes drift velocity, which is the velocity of the fluid parcels in the wave, is also affected by the wave steepness. As the wave steepness increases, the Stokes drift velocity decreases, and the fluid parcels begin to move more slowly. This is because the increased wave steepness results in a larger gradient in the velocity potential, which in turn leads to a smaller Stokes drift velocity.

In shallow water, the wave steepness is limited by the depth of the water. As the water depth decreases, the wave steepness increases, and the waves become more prone to breaking. This is because the decreased water depth reduces the amount of water available to support the wave, causing the wave to become more unstable and prone to breaking.

In addition to the wave steepness, the wave height is also affected by the ambient current. As the ambient current increases, the wave height also increases, due to the Doppler shift. This is because the increased current causes the wave crests to move faster, resulting in a higher wave height. However, if the ambient current opposes the waves, the wave height can actually decrease, due to the dissipative effects of the current on the wave energy.

In summary, the wave steepness is a fundamental parameter in the study of ocean waves, and it is directly proportional to the non-linearity of the waves. The wave steepness is affected by the balance between the gravitational force and the viscous forces resisting the motion of the water, as well as by the ambient current. In shallow water, the wave steepness is limited by the depth of the water, and the waves become more prone to breaking as the wave steepness increases.
r1: A Stokes wave is a nonlinear and periodic surface wave. The ratio of a wave's height and length is called wave steepness. The theory used to describe wave steepness is the airy wave theory.
r2: In fluid dynamics, a Stokes wave is a nonlinear and periodic surface wave on an inviscid fluid layer of constant mean depth. The ratio of a wave's height and length is called wave steepness. Airy wave theory describes the ratio of a wave's height and length.

a: Most star formation in the Milky Way occurs in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, which is one of the two major spiral arms of the galaxy. This is based on observations of the distribution of red giants, which are more abundant in this arm compared to the other arm, the Carina-Sagittarius arm. Additionally, surveys of near-infrared light have detected an overabundance of red giants in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, but not in the Carina-Sagittarius arm. This suggests that the Scutum-Centaurus arm is more active in terms of star formation compared to the other arm. Furthermore, the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions in the Milky Way matches the four-arm spiral description of the galaxy, indicating that the galaxy has four spiral arms in total, with two traced by old stars and two traced by gas and young stars. The Scutum-Centaurus arm is the most prominent arm in terms of star formation activity, and it is where most of the star formation in the Milky Way takes place.
r1: The Milky Way appears to have two spiral arms, the Scutum–Centaurus arm, as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars. Most star formations take place in the spiral arms of the Milky Way in the 5-kpc ring.

a: The Treaty of Versailles was signed by Germany on June 28, 1919, marking the end of World War I and the beginning of a new era of international relations. The treaty was signed by Hermann Müller and Johannes Bell, representatives of the German government, after the National Assembly voted in favor of signing the treaty by a margin of 237 to 138. The treaty was the result of six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference, and it imposed significant penalties on Germany, including territorial concessions, reparations, and disarmament.

The signing of the Treaty of Versailles was a controversial event, with conservatives, nationalists, and ex-military leaders in Germany condemning the treaty as an unfair surrender to the Allied powers. These groups believed that the treaty betrayed the sacrifices made by German soldiers during the war and would weaken Germany's position in the world. In contrast, politicians of the Weimar Republic, socialists, communists, and Jews were seen as having played a role in selling out Germany to its enemies.

The treaty's Article 231, known as the War Guilt clause, was particularly contentious, as it required Germany to accept responsibility for causing all the loss and damage during the war. This provision was seen as a way for the Allied powers to shift the blame for the war onto Germany and to justify the harsh penalties imposed by the treaty. The treaty also required Germany to make significant territorial concessions, including the loss of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the dissolution of the German Empire.

Despite the controversy surrounding the treaty, it was ratified by the National Assembly on July 9, 1919, by a vote of 209 to 116. The treaty marked the end of Germany's role as a major world power and set the stage for the rise of the Weimar Republic, which struggled to come to terms with the terms of the treaty and the political and economic instability that followed. The Treaty of Versailles remains a significant event in modern history, as it marked the end of World War I and set the stage for the rise of new political and economic order in Europe and the world.

a: The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics were produced in 1992 by the Computer Ethics Institute, as introduced in the paper "In Pursuit of a 'Ten Commandments' for Computer Ethics" by Ramon C. Barquin. The commandments were created as a means to establish a set of standards for the ethical use of computers, building upon the Internet Advisory Board's memo on ethics from 1987. The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics are notable for their archaic style, modeled after the Ten Commandments from the King James Bible. While they have been widely quoted in computer ethics literature, they have also been subject to criticism from both the hacker community and some academics. Dr. Ben Fairweather of the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility has described them as "simplistic" and overly restrictive, while ISC2, a thought leader in the information security industry, has incorporated the commandments into its own ethics rules. Despite these criticisms, the Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics remain an influential framework for ethical computing practices.

a: The best rushing quarterback of all time is a subject of much debate and can be evaluated in various ways, but when considering both the National Football League (NFL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Michael Vick stands out as a top contender. Vick, a former NFL quarterback, holds the record for the highest yards-per-carry in NFL history with at least 750 carries, with an impressive 6.4 yards per carry. This is significantly higher than the average yards-per-carry in the NFL, which is around 4 yards per carry. Vick's ability to rush the ball effectively and consistently is a testament to his exceptional athleticism and skill as a quarterback.

Moreover, Vick's career statistics in the NFL are impressive, with 4,409 career carries for 6,109 yards and 48 touchdowns. His ability to rush the ball and create plays with his feet is a key reason why he is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. Additionally, Vick's success on the field is not limited to his rushing abilities, as he also has a strong arm and is a skilled passer.

In comparison to other quarterbacks in the NCAA and NFL, Vick's rushing statistics are among the best. He outperforms other notable quarterbacks such as Cam Newton and Johnny Manziel, who have also had successful rushing careers. Vick's ability to rush the ball effectively and create plays with his feet is a key reason why he is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.

However, it's important to note that the NFL and NCAA have different rules regarding sacks, which can affect a quarterback's rushing statistics. In the NFL, sacks are not counted as part of a quarterback's passing or rushing yardage, while in the NCAA, sacks are counted as part of the team's passing yardage. This means that Vick's rushing statistics in the NFL may be slightly inflated compared to his college statistics, where sacks were counted as part of his rushing yardage.

Overall, while there are other great rushing quarterbacks in the NFL and NCAA, Michael Vick's impressive career statistics, athleticism, and skill as a quarterback make him a strong contender for the title of the best rushing quarterback of all time.
r1: The best rushing quarterback of all time depends on which league or division you are talking about. If it is the NFL, it is Michael Vick, the CFL, well that would be Tracy Ham. Keenan Reynolds in the FBS, Matt Cannon for the FCS, Jason Vander Laan for National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 2 and Ayrton Scott in Division 3.

a: The Rolling Stones have had a rich history of lead guitarists, with several notable musicians contributing to the band's sound over the years. Brian Jones, the original leader of the group, played lead guitar on many of the band's early recordings, including their first major single, "The Last Time." However, as the band's primary songwriters, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, assumed leadership and began to write more original material, Jones' contributions began to dwindle. He left the band in 1969, just before his death, and was replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained with the band until 1974. Ronnie Wood joined the band in 1975 and has been playing lead guitar alongside Richards ever since.

The interplay between the two guitarists has been a key element of the Rolling Stones' sound, with Richards referring to it as the "ancient art of weaving." This dynamic is particularly evident in the band's live performances, where Wood and Richards often trade licks and solos, creating a dynamic and engaging sound.

In addition to their lead guitarists, the Rolling Stones have also had a number of other notable musicians contribute to their sound over the years. Ian Stewart, the band's original pianist, was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to tour with the band until his death in 1985. Other musicians who have contributed to the band's sound include bassist Bill Wyman, drummer Charlie Watts, and keyboardists Nicky Hopkins, Ian McLagan, Billy Preston, and Chuck Leavell.

In recent years, the Rolling Stones have continued to tour and release new music, including a re-issue of their classic album "Exile on Main St." in 2010. The band has also been the subject of a number of documentaries and films, including "Stones in Exile" and "Crossfire Hurricane." Despite the passing of time and the changes in their line-up, the Rolling Stones remain one of the most iconic and influential rock bands of all time, with a legacy that continues to inspire and entertain audiences around the world.
r1: The guitar players for the English rock band, the Rolling Stones, were Brian Jones, who founded the band, in 1962 to 1969, Mick Taylor from 1969 to 1974, Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards.

a: A studio apartment, as defined by the provided factoid context, is a small apartment that combines living, dining, and sleeping areas into one room. The size of a studio apartment can vary, but on average, it is around 500 to 600 square feet (46-56 square meters) in the United States. This is relatively small compared to other types of apartments, which typically have separate rooms for each function. The kitchen and bathroom are usually located in separate areas within the studio apartment, but they may be combined into a single room in some cases. The variety of studio apartment sizes and layouts can be attributed to the different types of studio apartments available, such as the straight studio and the alcove studio. The alcove studio has a wing or nook that can be used for dining or sleeping, adding to the overall functional space of the apartment. Despite their smaller size, studio apartments can be highly functional and efficient, making them an attractive option for individuals or couples looking for affordable and convenient living spaces.

a: The implantation of the fertilized ovum usually occurs in the uterus, specifically in the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. During the early stages of development, the fertilized egg, now called a zygote, undergoes several cell divisions and grows into a ball of cells called a blastocyst. Around 10 days after fertilization, the blastocyst implants itself into the endometrium, where it begins to receive nutrients and support from the mother's body. The endometrium is prepared for implantation through a process called decidualization, which involves the thickening and changing of the endometrial lining to create a suitable environment for the developing embryo.

The timing of implantation is critical, as the endometrium is only receptive to implantation during a specific window of time, known as the implantation window. This window is typically around day 10-12 after fertilization, and it is important to time the transfer of the embryo to the uterus accordingly to maximize the chances of successful implantation.

In the case of frozen embryo transfer, the endometrium must be prepared before the transfer to ensure that it is receptive to the implanting embryo. This can be done through hormonal preparation, such as estrogen and progesterone, to thicken and ready the endometrium for implantation. The timing of hormonal preparation is critical, as the endometrium is only receptive for a limited time period, and the embryo must be transferred during this window to maximize the chances of successful implantation.

In summary, the implantation of the fertilized ovum usually occurs in the uterus, specifically in the endometrium, and the timing of implantation is critical to ensure successful implantation. The endometrium is prepared for implantation through decidualization, and hormonal preparation can be used to ensure that the endometrium is receptive to the implanting embryo in the case of frozen embryo transfer.
r1: The implantation of a fertilized ovum occurs in the uterine lining. The fundus in the uterus is where in the human body a fertilized ovum is usually implanted, and a female is considered to be pregnant.
r2: The fertilized female reproductive cell, called an egg cell or ovum, is implanted in the uterine lining of a portion of the uterus called the fundus. The fundus is the uppermost rounded portion of the uterus, one of four anatomical portions of the uterus, including the fundus, the corpus, the cervix, and the cervical canal.

a: Florida stopped using the electric chair in 2000, following a series of high-profile executions in the 1990s that raised concerns about the method's reliability and humaneness. During Bob Butterworth's tenure as Attorney General, the state experienced several instances of malfunctions in the electric chair, including the notorious cases of Jesse Tafero, Pedro Medina, and Allen Lee Davis. These executions were marred by flames shooting out of the prisoners' heads, leading to questions about whether the method constituted cruel and unusual punishment. In response to these incidents, Butterworth commented that those who commit murder in Florida may face issues with the electric chair. In 2000, the state legislature voted to replace the electric chair with lethal injection, which was deemed a more humane and reliable method of execution. This change was made in response to the public's growing unease with the electric chair and the mounting evidence of its fallibility. Today, lethal injection is the sole method of execution in Florida, and the state has not carried out an execution by electric chair since 2000.
r1: The state of Florida executed the last person in their state by electric chair in 1999 but the prisoner may still be electrocuted at their request. Lethal injection was passed into law in 2000 after pressure from the U.S. Supreme Court.

a: When do they stop selling beer in Wisconsin?

Wisconsin's alcohol laws have a rich history, with restrictions and regulations dating back to the state's early years. While the state has relaxed some of its laws over time, there are still limitations on when and where alcohol can be sold.

Prior to Prohibition, Wisconsin had relatively lax alcohol laws. However, with the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919, the state banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol. Prohibition lasted until 1933, when the 21st Amendment repealed it.

After Prohibition, Wisconsin's alcohol laws underwent significant changes. In 1926, voters approved a referendum allowing the manufacture of beer, and in 1929, the state repealed its law enforcing Prohibition. However, the state still prohibits the retail sale of liquor and wine between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and beer between midnight and 6:00 a.m.

Local municipalities in Wisconsin also have the power to restrict or ban the retail sale of alcohol. For example, the city of Sparta and the village of Ephraim previously banned the retail sale of alcohol, but voters in Sparta narrowly passed a referendum in 2014 to allow the sale of beer and wine in groceries and convenience stores. Ephraim voters passed a similar referendum in 2016 to allow the sale of beer and wine in restaurants and businesses.

In summary, the sale of beer in Wisconsin is allowed, but there are restrictions on the hours of sale and local municipalities may have additional regulations or bans in place. The state's alcohol laws have evolved over time, reflecting changing attitudes towards alcohol consumption and the influence of local communities.
r1: On January 17, 1920, Wisconsin stopped selling beer due to Prohibition. After Prohibition ended, beer is to be not sold after midnight.
r2: Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages from 1920 to 1933. Prohibition began on January 17, 1920, when the Volstead Act went into effect. Wisconsin state law prohibits retail sale of liquor and wine between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and beer between midnight and 6:00 a.m. In Wisconsin they stop selling beer at midnight each day.

a: The programmer of MS-DOS was Tim Paterson, an American computer programmer who created 86-DOS, an operating system for the Intel 8086 processor. 86-DOS was later developed into MS-DOS, which became the most widely used personal computer operating system in the 1980s. Paterson was educated in the Seattle Public Schools and graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Computer Science in 1978. He went on to work for Seattle Computer Products, where he designed the hardware for Microsoft's Z-80 SoftCard and later the S-100 8086 board. Without a true operating system for the board, sales were slow, but Paterson's 86-DOS, which emulated the API of CP/M, was later adopted by IBM as PC DOS 1.0 and became the standard operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers. Over time, MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000, and was gradually replaced by graphical user interface (GUI) operating systems such as Microsoft Windows.
r1: The programmer of 86-DOS, the basis of the MS-DOS operating system, was Tim Paterson. MS-DOS is the acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System.

a: Bruce Springsteen played the Super Bowl halftime show on February 1, 2009, as part of Super Bowl XLIII. This performance was a highlight of his successful career, which had already included numerous accolades and accomplishments. In the years leading up to the Super Bowl, Springsteen had been dealing with the loss of his longtime keyboardist, Danny Federici, who had passed away in April 2008 after a three-year battle with melanoma. Despite this setback, Springsteen continued to perform and produce music, including the song "The Wrestler," which won him a Golden Globe Award in January 2009. When he was offered the opportunity to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, Springsteen agreed, and he promised a "twelve-minute party" for the audience. His performance did not disappoint, as he and the E Street Band, along with the Miami Horns, delivered a high-energy set that included abbreviated versions of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," "Born to Run," "Working on a Dream," and "Glory Days," with football-themed lyrics substituted for the original baseball references. This performance capped off a successful year for Springsteen, who had continued to produce and perform music despite the challenges he faced, and it solidified his status as one of the most beloved and enduring musicians of his generation.

a: The first voyage to circumnavigate the globe was led by Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, between 1519 and 1522. The expedition, known as the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation, was commissioned by the Spanish crown to find a maritime route from Spain to East Asia through the Americas and the Pacific Ocean. The journey began in Seville, Spain, with five ships and 270 men, including Magellan as the captain general. The fleet crossed the Atlantic Ocean and wintered in South America before navigating the Strait of Magellan, which was discovered by the expedition, and entering the Pacific Ocean. The journey continued with the discovery of several islands, including Guam, before arriving in the Philippines.

After Magellan's death in the Philippines, the expedition was led by Juan Sebastian Elcano, a Basque navigator, who successfully completed the circumnavigation and returned to Spain in 1522. The Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation was a groundbreaking achievement that marked the first time in human history that a single expedition had circumnavigated the globe. The journey not only opened up new trade routes between Europe and Asia but also provided valuable knowledge of the world's oceans, geography, and cultures. The expedition's success paved the way for future explorations and established Spain as a major maritime power during the Age of Exploration.
r1: Ferdinand Magellan's Spanish expedition was the first to successfully circumnavigate the globe. Magellan led the voyage in 1519, but was killed in 1521. After his death, the voyage was completed under the leadership of Juan Sebastián Elcano, returning to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain, on 6 September 1522.
r2: Ferdinand Magellan was leading the first voyage to circumnavigate the globe at the voyage's start, but Juan Sebastián Elcano was leading at its end. Magellan died in the Philippines at the hands of the natives in 1521, and, following several other short-lived leaderships, Elcano took command of the expedition to finally reach the Spice Islands. Elcano then decided to return to Spain across the Indian Ocean and up the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the first circumnavigation of the world in 1522.

a: The federal student loan program in the United States has a long and complex history, with various legislative changes and updates over the years. The program was first introduced in 1958 under the National Defense Education Act (NDEA), which provided government-backed loans to students studying specific fields such as engineering, science, and education. The program was later expanded in the 1960s under the Higher Education Act of 1965, which aimed to encourage greater social mobility and equality of opportunity. The Act increased federal funding for universities, created scholarships, and provided low-interest loans for students.

In 1992, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act eliminated guaranteed loans, which were seen as benefiting private student loan companies at the expense of taxpayers, and replaced them with the Federal Direct Loan Program. This program provides low-interest loans directly to students and parents, rather than through private lenders, and is now the sole government-backed loan program in the United States.

The Federal Direct Loan Program has seen significant funding increases over the years, with funding for new direct loans increasing from $12.6 billion in 2005 to $17.8 billion in 2008. Today, student loans are available for any college-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, computers, and transportation expenses. However, an unusual provision in the law prohibits student loans from being discharged through bankruptcy.

In summary, the federal student loan program in the United States has evolved over the years to provide low-interest loans directly to students and parents, with the goal of increasing access to higher education and reducing financial barriers. The program has undergone significant changes and updates, including the elimination of guaranteed loans and the expansion of the Federal Direct Loan Program. Today, student loans are a vital source of financial aid for millions of students and families seeking to pursue higher education.
r1: United States Government-backed student loans were first offered in 1958 under the National Defense Education Act (NDEA). However, they were only available to select categories of students, such as those studying engineering, science or education degrees. The Higher Education Act of 1965 was signed into law on November 8, 1965. It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, and gave low-interest loans to students, which gave greater college access to women and minorities. In 1992, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program started. This was an attempt to give universal access to education loans by creating an "unsubsidized" version of the loans. Loans were available to any student, regardless of whether the financial aid formulas determined that they had unmet need.
r2: Student loans are a form of financial aid used to help students access higher education. The United States Government started to offer student loans in 1958. On November 8, 1965 the federal low-interest student loan program began, with The Higher Education Act of 1965, as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society domestic agenda, and in 1992 President George H. W. Bush authorized a pilot version of the Direct Loan program, by signing into law the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

a: To change a lead atom into a gold atom, a process known as nuclear transmutation would be required. Nuclear transmutation involves the conversion of one chemical element into another through changes to the nucleus of the atom, specifically by adding or removing protons or neutrons. However, this process is not a simple task and requires a significant amount of energy to achieve.

In nature, nuclear transmutation occurs through stellar nucleosynthesis, where stars fuse elements together to create heavier elements. This process can create elements up to iron, but elements heavier than iron require more energy to produce and are not feasible for stars to create. Therefore, the transmutation of lead into gold is not possible through natural processes.

In laboratory settings, nuclear transmutation has been achieved through nuclear reactions and radioactive decay. However, these processes are highly complex and expensive, and the energy required to transmutate lead into gold far exceeds any potential gain. For example, Glenn Seaborg was able to produce several thousand atoms of gold from bismuth through a complex process involving neutron capture and beta decay, but at a net loss.

Therefore, it is not currently possible to change lead into gold through nuclear transmutation, and any attempts to do so would be highly unlikely to be cost-effective or practical. The abundance of gold in the universe is largely due to the natural processes of stellar nucleosynthesis, and the idea of transmuting lead into gold through alchemical means remains a myth.
r1: There is more than one way to turn lead into gold. One of those ways is with a process called nuclear transmutation, by which one chemical element or an isotope is converted into another chemical element. This is an expensive process that exceeds what could be gained from selling the converted gold. And easier and cheaper way is via neutron capture and beta decay. Essentially, the conversion is achieved by leaving lead in a nuclear reactor for a long period of time.
r2: There are two different processes that can potentially change a lead atom into a gold atom. One process is nuclear transmutation, which is when the amount of protons or neutrons in an atom is changed. This changes the element because elements are defined by their number of protons and neutrons in its atom. While transmutation has successfully been used to turn lead into gold, it is far too expensive to provide any tangible benefit. The easier process to change lead to gold is neutron capture and beta decay, which is the process of one or more neutrons and a nucleus collide and merge to form a heavier nucleus.

a: The song "Eye in the Sky" was performed by the British rock band The Alan Parsons Project, from their sixth studio album of the same name, released in June 1982. The album was a major success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries and featuring the band's biggest hit, the title track with lead vocals by Eric Woolfson. The song "Eye in the Sky" hit #3 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. in October 1982, #1 in both Canada and Spain, and #6 in New Zealand. The instrumental piece "Sirius" segues into "Eye in the Sky" on the original recording, but was edited out of the single release, which is why album-oriented rock and classic rock stations almost exclusively include the "Sirius" intro. Critics in Europe and North America have pointed to similarities between the melody of Lady Antebellum's 2010 single "Need You Now" and "Eye in the Sky".

The Alan Parsons Project was an English rock band active between 1975 and 1990, with a core membership consisting of Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson. The band's music was characterized by a blend of cool and funky styles, with lyrical and heavily orchestrated songs. The album "Eye in the Sky" was the last platinum record in the United States from the band, and it is reportedly their best-selling album. The album was recorded on analogue equipment and mixed directly to the digital master tape, a fact not widely known until the liner notes of "Vulture Culture".

Alan Parsons, the audio engineer and producer, met Eric Woolfson, the songwriter and composer, in the canteen of Abbey Road Studios in the summer of 1974. Almost all the songs on the Project's albums are credited to "Woolfson/Parsons". The band's music was characterized by a blend of cool and funky styles, with lyrical and heavily orchestrated songs, and their biggest hit, "Eye in the Sky", is a prime example of their unique sound.

a: McCrory's, a chain of five and dime stores, went out of business in 2002 after a long history dating back to 1882. The company was founded by John Graham McCrorey in Scottdale, Pennsylvania, and it grew to operate over 1,300 stores across the United States by 1989. However, the company faced financial difficulties in the 1990s and filed for bankruptcy in 1992. It closed 300 stores in 1997 and converted some remaining stores to its Dollar Zone format, but these closed in early 2002. In December 2001, McCrory Stores announced that the remaining stores would begin liquidating, and by February 2002, the company had ceased operation.

The history of McCrory's can be traced back to the early 1900s when John Graham McCrorey founded the first store in Scottdale, Pennsylvania. The chain grew rapidly, and by 1925, it had over 180 stores across the eastern and southern United States. The company was known for its thrifty nature, and its stores typically sold a wide range of items, including shoes, clothing, housewares, fabrics, penny candy, toys, cosmetics, and often included a lunch counter or snack bar. McCrory's also exclusively sold Oriole Records, a popular 'dime store label' from 1921 to 1938.

However, the company faced financial difficulties in the 1930s, and it declared bankruptcy in 1933. The company was re-established as McCrory Stores and resumed operations, but it never fully recovered from the effects of the Great Depression. In the 1980s, the company purchased the remaining Kresge and Jupiter stores from the Kmart Corporation, which had long given up on the variety store division. This move reunited the companies and led to the conversion of all stores to the McCrory banner.

Despite this effort, McCrory's continued to face financial challenges, and by the 1990s, the company was struggling to compete with larger retailers like Walmart and Target. In 1992, the company filed for bankruptcy and closed over 300 stores. It converted some remaining stores to its Dollar Zone format, but these closed in early 2002. In December 2001, McCrory Stores announced that the remaining stores would begin liquidating, and by February 2002, the company had ceased operation.

Overall, McCrory's struggled to adapt to changing consumer preferences and the rise of larger retailers, leading to its eventual demise in 2002. The chain's legacy lives on, however, as a reminder of the importance of adapting to changing market conditions and the impact of economic downturns on even the most successful businesses.
r1: The U.S. based five and dime store established in 1882, McCrory's, was once a successful business with hundreds of chain locations. Despite its early success, the company entered bankruptcy in January 1933. Fortunately, they were able to re-establish themselves and continue to grow once more. However, they had to file for bankruptcy again in 1992 due to the changing retail landscape. Superstores such as Target and Walmart took the shoppers who once frequented the five and dime stores. The company finally had to close its doors in February 2002.
r2: McCrory Stores or J.G. McCrory's was a chain of five and dime stores in the United States based in York, Pennsylvania.

a: The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles is a pivotal event in Christian theology and is commemorated on the Pentecost, which is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Easter. According to the Acts of the Apostles, this event took place while the apostles and other followers of Jesus were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, fifty days after the resurrection of Jesus. The Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles in the form of tongues of fire, and they began to speak in different languages, enabling them to proclaim the gospel message to people of all nations. This event represents the birth of the early Church and is considered a turning point in human history, as it marked the beginning of the spread of Christianity throughout the world.

The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles is closely tied to the mission of Jesus Christ, as it empowered them to fulfill his Great Commission to go and make disciples of all nations. The Holy Spirit gave them the courage, wisdom, and strength they needed to face the challenges of spreading the gospel message in a hostile world. The apostles, who were once fearful and hesitant, became bold and confident in their faith, and they went on to spread the gospel message to the ends of the earth.

The Holy Spirit is also seen as a symbol of God's presence and power in the world, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles is seen as a manifestation of God's love and grace for humanity. The gift of the Holy Spirit is available to all believers, and it is seen as a source of spiritual guidance, strength, and comfort.

In Christian tradition, the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles is also associated with the giving of spiritual gifts, such as the ability to speak in tongues, heal the sick, and perform miracles. These gifts were given to the apostles and other believers as a sign of God's power and presence, and they were used to confirm the message of the gospel and to bring people to faith in Jesus Christ.

Overall, the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles is a central event in Christian theology and is seen as a turning point in human history. It empowered the apostles to fulfill their mission of spreading the gospel message, and it continues to be a source of spiritual guidance, strength, and comfort for all believers today.

The production team filmed for 18 weeks, taking advantage of the stunning natural beauty of the area, which includes the picturesque Lake Moke, the setting for the women's commune.

Lake Moke, located near the suburb of Closeburn in Queenstown, is a popular recreation spot known for its boating, camping, horseback riding, and swimming opportunities. The lake's tranquil atmosphere and breathtaking scenery made it an ideal location for the series, particularly for the scenes set in the women's commune. The track that encircles the lake also provided a convenient path for filmmakers to access the area.

Despite the show's original intention to be a co-production with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the network pulled their funding due to a prior agreement to feature an Australian actress in the lead role. However, UKTV, owned by BBC Worldwide, stepped in to fill the funding gap, allowing the series to go ahead with its original creative vision.

The success of "Top of the Lake" led to a sequel, "Top of the Lake: China Girl," which was filmed in Sydney, Australia, four years after the events of the first season. The sequel follows Detective Robin Griffin as she investigates the death of an unidentified Asian girl found at Bondi Beach. Once again, the show's creators chose to film on location, taking advantage of the unique and diverse landscapes that each location has to offer.

Overall, the filming locations for "Top of the Lake" and "Top of the Lake: China Girl" played a crucial role in bringing the story and characters to life, and the stunning natural beauty of the locations added an extra layer of depth and atmosphere to the series.
r1: The television drama, Top of the Lake, was filmed in multiple locations. The first season was filmed entirely in Queenstown and Glenorchy, in Otago, on the South Island of New Zealand.

a: The song "Friday" by Rebecca Black has gained notoriety for receiving almost universally negative reviews from music critics, with some even calling it the "worst song ever." The video for the song has also been met with widespread dislike on YouTube, where it was once the most disliked video on the platform with over 3 million dislikes, accounting for 88% of the total ratings. The video's negative reception has been attributed to its poor songwriting, instrumentation, and Black's singing voice, as well as the video choreography. The song's success on YouTube, however, has been contrasted with the negative reception it received from music critics and social media users.

In contrast, Justin Bieber's video for "Baby" was also met with a large number of dislikes on YouTube, but it has not received the same level of negative attention as "Friday." While "Baby" has received over 9.93 million dislikes, it has also been viewed over 4.5 billion times, making it one of the most viewed videos on the platform. Bieber has also been successful on social media, with over 6 million followers on Twitter and being the second most followed user on the platform as of 2017. His VEVO channel is also the second most subscribed channel on YouTube.

The contrast between the negative reception of "Friday" and the success of "Baby" highlights the subjective nature of online popularity and the diverse opinions of users on social media platforms. While some users may find a video or song to be entertaining or catchy, others may find it to be poorly made or offensive. The success of "Friday" on YouTube, despite its negative reception, demonstrates the power of viral content and the ability of users to create and share content that resonates with a wide audience, regardless of its quality. On the other hand, the success of "Baby" and Bieber's social media presence demonstrates the ability of artists to build a large following and achieve mainstream success through their online presence.

a: The origin of the phrase "Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better" can be traced back to the 1946 Broadway musical "Annie Get Your Gun," with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin. The song, also titled "Anything You Can Do," is a duet between the male and female leads, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler, who engage in a playful and competitive exchange of boasts about their skills and abilities. The song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting contest between the two characters and showcases their growing romantic tension.

The lyrics of the song are notable for their witty and lighthearted banter, with each character attempting to one-up the other in increasingly impressive feats, such as singing softer, higher, sweeter, and holding a note for longer. However, despite their boasts, neither character can claim to be able to bake a pie, a humorous touch that adds to the playfulness of the scene.

The song was first performed in "Annie Get Your Gun" by Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton, who brought the characters and their banter to life on stage. Since then, the song has become a classic of American musical theater and has been covered by many artists over the years. The phrase "Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better" has also become a popular catchphrase and cultural reference, often used humorously or ironically to express a sense of competition or one-upmanship.

Overall, "Anything You Can Do" is a delightful and memorable song that showcases the playful and competitive spirit of the characters in "Annie Get Your Gun," and its catchy lyrics and melody have made it a timeless classic of American musical theater.

a: The next king or queen of England is not yet determined, as the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is still reigning. However, according to the rules of succession outlined in the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, the next in line to the throne after Queen Elizabeth II will be her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. If Prince Charles were to ascend to the throne, his eldest son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, would be next in line, followed by Prince William's children, including Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, is currently sixth in line to the throne. It is worth noting that under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line to the throne require the sovereign's consent before they marry, and without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.

It is also worth mentioning that, as Princess consort, the wife of a sovereign prince is accorded an official title or informal designation, and the term is only capitalized when the title is borne officially. Currently, there are two sovereign princesses consort in Europe: Marie, Princess of Liechtenstein and Charlene, Princess of Monaco. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has announced that when her husband Charles, Prince of Wales, accedes to the throne of the United Kingdom, she will not use the legal style of Queen consort, but instead, she will use the style of "Princess consort", which has no historical precedent, as wives of kings automatically become queens under English common law.
r1: Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. The next in line for Queen would be Charles, Prince of Wales' wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, when Charles becomes King after Elizabeth II.
r2: Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, sex (males born before 28 October 2011 precede their elder sisters in the line of succession), legitimacy, and religion. Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. He would be the next King of England. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, would be the next Queen of England.

a: The 2018 FIFA World Cup is taking place in Russia this year, but the question is asking about the location of the tournament in previous years. In 2014, the FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, specifically in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Rio de Janeiro is a popular tourist destination known for its natural beauty, vibrant culture, and iconic landmarks such as the Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf Mountain. The city has a rich history of hosting major international events, including the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, and has invested heavily in infrastructure and security to ensure a successful FIFA World Cup.

In recent years, the city has made significant efforts to improve its safety and reduce crime, with the murder rate dropping sharply from 43 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2007 to 29.4 per 100,000 in 2016. This is partly due to the help of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was enlisted to help bring down the crime rate.

Johannesburg, South Africa also hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2010, and the city underwent significant development and investment in preparation for the event. The city has a rich sports culture, with popular sports including association football, cricket, rugby union, and running. The city is home to several football clubs in the Premier Soccer League and the National First Division, and the top teams in the city are known for their fierce rivalries.

The Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany has also hosted the FIFA World Cup in the past, specifically in 1974 and 2006. The stadium was originally built for the 1936 Summer Olympics and has undergone several renovations since then. It has a capacity of 74,475 seats and is one of the largest stadiums in Germany for international football matches. The stadium has a rich footballing tradition and has hosted numerous high-profile events, including the German Cup final and the UEFA Champions League Final.

Overall, the locations of the FIFA World Cup have been diverse, with different cities and countries hosting the event over the years. Each location has brought its own unique culture and history to the tournament, making it a truly global event.

a: The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be held in Qatar, marking the first time the tournament will be hosted in the Arab world and the first time in a Muslim-majority country. However, the hosting of the tournament has been marred by concerns over the treatment of migrant workers, with reports of human rights abuses and exploitation. An investigation by The Guardian found that many workers are denied basic rights such as food and water, have their identity papers taken away, and are not paid on time or at all, effectively making them modern-day slaves. It is estimated that up to 4,000 workers may die due to lax safety standards and other causes by the time the competition is held. These allegations have led to calls for boycotts of the tournament and pressure on the Qatari government to improve working conditions.

The tournament is also notable for its unique schedule, with the games being held in late November and December instead of the traditional June and July dates. This is due to concerns over the extreme heat in Qatar during the summer months, which can reach temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius. The reduced timeframe of around 28 days and the use of cooling technology in the stadiums are intended to mitigate the heat.

The 2022 FIFA World Cup has also been embroiled in controversy over allegations of corruption and bribery in the bidding process. Accusations have been made that Qatar won the right to host the tournament through unethical means, leading to calls for investigations and reform within FIFA.

Despite these challenges, the 2022 FIFA World Cup is set to be a groundbreaking event in the world of football, bringing attention to the Middle East and highlighting the region's growing influence in the global sports landscape. With the tournament just around the corner, the world will be watching to see how Qatar handles the challenges it faces and how the event ultimately unfolds.
r1: The 2022 FIFA World Cup competition is scheduled to take place in Qatar. This will be the first World Cup ever to be held in the Arab world. The host cities within Qatar will be Doha, Lusail, Al Wakrah, Al Rayyan, and Al Khor. The host cities are constructing stadiums that are marketed as Zero Waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.
r2: The FIFA World Cup competition is the quadrennial international men's football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA.

a: The United Kingdom conducts a census every ten years, with the most recent one taking place in 2011. This is in line with the tradition of conducting a census every ten years since 1801, with the exceptions of 1941 during World War II and Ireland in 1921. The census provides detailed information about the national demographics and plays an important role in the allocation of resources to regional and local service providers by both the UK and European Union governments. The results of the census are also used for other purposes such as urban and regional planning, education, and healthcare.

The history of the census in the UK can be traced back to Roman times, with tax assessments being made in Britain, but detailed records have not survived. In the 7th century, Dál Riata conducted a census, known as the "Tradition of the Men of Alba." England conducted its first formal census in 1086 under William the Conqueror for tax purposes. The modern national decennial censuses of the general population started in 1801, championed by the statistician John Rickman. The census has been an important tool for understanding the demographic changes and trends in the UK, and has played a significant role in shaping policies and resource allocation decisions.
r1: The UK has taken a census since 1801, except for a few years during war or other extenuating circumstances. The census in the United Kingdom is decennial, that is, held every 10 years, although there is provision in the Census Act 1920 for a census to take place at intervals of every 5 years or more. There have only been two occasions where the census has not been decennial: There was no census in 1941 due to the Second World War; and a mini-census using a ten percent sample of the population was conducted on 24 April 1966.
r2: In the UK, the census is normally done every 10 years. However, according to the Census act of 1920, the census could be take place every 5 years.

a: In 1830, the ruler of France was Louis Philippe I, who ascended to the throne after his cousin Charles X was forced to abdicate during the July Revolution. Louis Philippe was born on October 6, 1773, as the son of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, who had supported the French Revolution but later fled the country after the execution of his cousin King Louis XVI. Louis Philippe spent 21 years in exile before returning to France during the Bourbon Restoration. He was proclaimed king on August 9, 1830, and his reign, known as the July Monarchy, was marked by conservative policies and close ties with Britain. He also sponsored colonial expansion, particularly the French conquest of Algeria. However, his popularity declined in 1847 as economic conditions in France deteriorated, and he was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848. He lived out the rest of his life in exile in the United Kingdom.

Louis Philippe's ascension to the throne was the result of a complex series of events, including the abdication of his cousin Charles X and the July Revolution. Charles X, who had succeeded his brother Louis XVIII as king in 1824, was a conservative who opposed the principles of the French Revolution and sought to reverse many of the reforms that had been implemented during the Revolution. This led to widespread discontent and eventually to the July Revolution, which forced Charles X to abdicate and flee to exile. Louis Philippe, who was supported by wealthy industrialists and bankers, was chosen as the new king due to his liberal leanings and his reputation as a moderate.

Despite his initial popularity, Louis Philippe's reign was marked by political and economic instability. His policies, which were influenced by the French statesman François Guizot, were seen as too conservative by many, and his support for colonial expansion and the French conquest of Algeria was controversial. Additionally, the economic downturn of 1847 and the subsequent revolution of 1848 further eroded his popularity, leading to his abdication and exile.

Overall, Louis Philippe's reign was marked by a complex set of political and social factors that ultimately led to his downfall. His legacy is still debated among historians, with some viewing him as a progressive and modernizing force, while others see him as a conservative who failed to address the social and economic problems of his time.
r1: Charles Philippe was the King of France from September 16, 1825, until August 2, 1830. After him, his cousin, Louis-Philippe, I reigned from August 9, 1830, until he was overthrown in 1848.
r2: Charles X (born Charles Philippe, Count of Artois) was King of France from 16 September 1824 until 2 August 1830. His reign of almost six years proved to be deeply unpopular from the moment of his coronation in 1825. France faced urban riots which led to the July Revolution of 1830, which resulted in his abdication and the election of Louis-Philippe I as King of the French. Louis-Philippe was sworn in as King Louis-Philippe I on 9 August 1830. Linking the monarchy to a people instead of a territory was aimed at undercutting the legitimist claims of Charles X and his family.

a: The last woolly mammoths died out approximately 10,000 years ago, during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. This is evident from the fact that the species coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for various purposes, and the remains of butchered mammoths have been found in several locations. However, the exact cause of their extinction is still a topic of debate among scientists. Some believe that hunting by humans, which was likely intensified as the mammoth population declined, was the primary factor, while others argue that climate change and the subsequent shrinkage of the mammoth's habitat were the main causes.

It is worth noting that different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but rather gradually became extinct over time. Isolated populations survived on remote islands such as St. Paul Island and Wrangel Island for a longer period, with the last ones disappearing around 5,600 and 4,000 years ago, respectively.

The woolly mammoth was a remarkable creature, with a distinctive coat of fur, long curved tusks, and a diet of mainly grasses and sedges. It shared many behavioral characteristics with modern elephants, and its intelligence and social structure were likely similar as well. The mammoth's habitat was the mammoth steppe, a vast expanse of grasslands that stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.

Despite their extinction, the woolly mammoths have left a lasting legacy, with their ivory being used for art, tools, and dwellings by early humans, and the tradition of using mammoth ivory continues to this day. The study of woolly mammoths has also provided valuable insights into the Earth's climate history and the evolution of large mammals, and their extinction serves as a reminder of the delicate balance of ecosystems and the impact of human activities on the natural world.
r1: Most woolly mammoth populations disappeared from its mainland range (across northern Eurasia and North America) between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods 10,000 years ago. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago.
r2: Most wooly mammoth populations disappeared over a period of several thousand years, but some survived well after, while mainland and island populations became extinct at different times. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The last mainland population existed in Siberia 9,650 years ago, while a small population survived on St. Paul Island in Alaska until around 5,600 BP, or years before present. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago.

a: Olympic National Park is located on the Olympic Peninsula in the state of Washington, encompassing four distinct regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas, temperate rainforest, and dry forests. Established as a national park in 1938, it was originally designated as a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. The park features three distinct ecosystems, including subalpine forest and wildflower meadows, temperate forest, and rugged Pacific coastline. The coastal region is characterized by rugged sandy beaches and dense forests, with native communities at the mouths of the Hoh and Quileute rivers. The park has been recognized for its unique biodiversity, designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976 and a World Heritage Site in 1981. In addition, 95% of the park has been designated as the Olympic Wilderness, offering untouched wilderness areas for hiking and exploration. The Olympic Peninsula is also home to the Wild Olympics campaign, which aims to protect additional wilderness areas, salmon streams, and provide opportunities for the park to purchase land from willing sellers. The peninsula is located in Clallam, Jefferson, and Grays Harbor counties, with the Kitsap Peninsula being a separate peninsula not connected to the Olympic Peninsula. The climate on the peninsula is predominantly oceanic, with a warm-summer Mediterranean climate in more populated areas. The park is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Derek Kilmer.

a: Based on the factoid context provided, no teams were relegated from the Premier League this year as the Premier League is a closed league and does not have a system of relegation. The Premier League is a corporation that operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL), but the Premier League clubs do not face the risk of relegation to a lower league. Instead, the bottom three teams in the Premier League table are relegated to the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football, and the top three teams in the EFL Championship are promoted to the Premier League. This means that the Premier League is a self-sustaining league where the teams that finish in the bottom three positions do not face relegation, but rather continue to compete in the Premier League for the following season.
r1: Many teams have gotten dropped from the Premier League since it was formed in 1992. A few of those teams are Hull City, Burnley Queens, and Park Rangers in the 2014-2015 season.

a: The distinctive smell of vanilla comes from the fruit of the vanilla orchid plant, which is a seed capsule that ripens and dries, releasing the characteristic aroma as it crystallizes. The fruit contains tiny black seeds, and both the pod and the seeds are used in cooking. The smell of vanilla is a result of the presence of phenolic compounds, which are responsible for the aroma and flavor of the plant. The unique scent of vanilla is highly prized and widely used in the food and cosmetics industries, and is often used to enhance the flavor of other ingredients such as chocolate, custard, and caramel. However, the use of artificial vanilla-like flavorings and substitutes, such as methyl and ethyl vanillin, is common due to the high cost of true vanilla. These substitutes are often used in baked goods and other applications, but the flavor of natural vanilla is generally considered to be superior.
r1: Vanilla is a spice derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily obtained from pods of the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla. It is widely used aroma and flavor compound for foods, beverages and cosmetics. The chemicals that give off the aroma are called phenolic compounds. They are found in the fruit, a seed capsule, if left on the plant. The fruit ripens and opens at the end. As it dries, the phenolic compounds crystallize, giving the fruits a diamond-dusted appearance, and releases the distinctive vanilla smell.

a: The idea of representative government can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as Mesopotamia and India, where councils and assemblies existed to provide guidance to kings and other leaders. However, the modern concept of representative democracy as we know it today originated in the Western world during the Middle Ages. The Roman Republic, which was the first known government in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies, was a significant influence on the development of representative democracy. The Roman model of governance, which held supreme power in the hands of the people and their elected representatives, inspired many political thinkers over the centuries.

In Europe, the concept of representative government evolved through the medieval tradition of selecting representatives from various estates to advise and control monarchs. This led to the development of parliamentary systems, with the first parliaments dating back to the 9th century in Iceland and the 12th century in León, Spain. However, it was not until the Dutch revolt in the 16th century that the modern concept of parliamentary government emerged, with the States General of the Netherlands taking over sovereign, legislative, and executive powers from the monarch.

The modern concept of representative democracy, as we know it today, developed in the Kingdom of Great Britain in the 18th century and in Sweden during the Age of Liberty. The idea of representative government was that the people would elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf, rather than having direct control over the government. This allowed for a more efficient and effective governance system, as the representatives could focus on the needs of the people and make decisions based on their best interests.

In conclusion, the idea of representative government has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations, but the modern concept of representative democracy as we know it today originated in the Western world during the Middle Ages and evolved over time through the development of parliamentary systems. The Roman Republic and the Dutch revolt were significant influences on the development of representative democracy, and the idea of representative government has continued to evolve and adapt to the needs of societies over time.
r1: The first parliaments date back to the Middle Ages. In 930, the first assembly of the Alþingi was convened at Þingvellir in Iceland, becoming the earliest version of a formalized parliamentary system. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies.
r2: The Roman Republic was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, this model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate it because supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives as opposed to a direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. The first parliaments date back to the Middle Ages, in 930, the first assembly of the Alþingi was convened at Þingvellir in Iceland, becoming the earliest version of a formalized parliamentary system; however, in 1188 Alfonso IX, King of Leon, in current day Spain, convened the three states in the Cortes of León and according to UNESCO it was the first sample of modern parliamentarism in the history of Europe.

a: The first foreigner to receive the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was Mother Teresa, who was awarded the honor in 1980. Although the award is usually conferred on India-born citizens, Mother Teresa, a naturalized citizen of India, was recognized for her exceptional service to the country's poor and marginalized communities. She was followed by two other non-Indians, Pakistan national Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and former South African President Nelson Mandela, who were awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1997 and 1998, respectively. These exceptions to the usual criteria highlight the extraordinary contributions made by these individuals to India and the world at large.

The Bharat Ratna, instituted in 1954, is conferred "in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order" in any field of human endeavor, without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex. The award is recommended by the Prime Minister to the President, with a maximum of three nominees being awarded per year. Recipients receive a Sanad signed by the President and a peepal-leaf-shaped medallion, but there is no monetary grant associated with the award.

Over the years, the Bharat Ratna has been bestowed upon 45 individuals, including 12 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards, but were amended in January 1955 to permit them. Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first individual to be honored posthumously.

The Bharat Ratna, along with other personal civil honors, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during the change in the national government, and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhas Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqué announcing Bose's award was cancelled, making it the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.

In conclusion, the Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award of the Republic of India, and its recipients are chosen for their exceptional service/performance of the highest order in any field of human endeavor. While the award is usually conferred on India-born citizens, exceptions have been made for foreigners who have made extraordinary contributions to the country, such as Mother Teresa, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and Nelson Mandela. The award has been bestowed upon 45 individuals, including 12 who were awarded posthumously, and has been subject to temporary suspensions and controversies over the years.
r1: Instituted on 2 January 1954, the Bharat Ratna Award in India is given to those who have been an example of exceptional service/performance of the highest order, without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.

a: According to the provided factoids, the philosophers Epicurus and Democritus, who lived in ancient Greece in the 4th and 5th centuries BCE, believed in the existence of atoms and the void as the fundamental constituents of reality. Epicurus, a student of Democritus, was less certain about the ability of atomism to explain specific natural phenomena such as earthquakes, lightning, comets, or the phases of the Moon. Despite this, he was convinced of the existence of atoms and the void, and his ideas were represented in the works of his follower Lucretius, who wrote "On the Nature of Things". Democritus, on the other hand, was a prolific writer who proposed that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles called atoms, and he believed that atoms were too small for human senses to detect, they were infinitely many, they come in infinitely many varieties, and that they had always existed.

The factoids highlight the contrast between atomism and substance theory, wherein a prime material continuum remains qualitatively invariant under division. Additionally, the factoids mention that Indian Buddhists, such as Dharmakirti, also developed distinctive theories of atomism, involving momentary (instantaneous) atoms that flash in and out of existence.

In summary, the factoids provide a comprehensive overview of the beliefs of Epicurus and Democritus regarding atoms and the void as the fundamental constituents of reality, and how their ideas were influenced by the broader philosophical and cultural context of ancient Greece. The factoids also highlight the significance of Democritus' contributions to the development of atomic theory and his influence on later scientific thought.
r1: The ancient Greek philosopher, Leucippus, is thought to have developed the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Democritus studied under Leucippus and is well known for his formulation of an atomic theory. Another philosopher of the time, was Epicurus. He was greatly influenced by Democritus. Together, the three proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms.
r2: Several philosophers thought atoms and the void comprised all of reality. The Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus, a pupil of Leucippus, originally did. In the 5th century BCE, Democritus and his mentor, Leucippus, proposed that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles called atoms. As a student of Democritus, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus also believed atoms and the void comprised all of reality.

a: The name of the time zone for London is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), also known as Western European Time (WET). This time zone is used in the United Kingdom and is based on the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. Prior to the adoption of GMT, the United Kingdom used Local Mean Time (LMT), which varied by location. The use of GMT was first adopted by the Great Western Railway in 1840, and it gradually became the standard time for the entire country. In 1880, the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act legally established GMT as the standard time for the island of Great Britain. Ireland adopted GMT in 1916, supplanting Dublin Mean Time. The United Kingdom observes daylight saving time, also known as British Summer Time (BST), which is set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. During daylight saving time, the time in the United Kingdom is one hour ahead of GMT. The time zone for London is part of the Eastern Time Zone, as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, and is observed in sync with the United States, with localized exceptions.

a: The first rocket to go into space was the V-2, which was developed by Wernher von Braun and was launched by Nazi Germany during World War II. However, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth was Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, during the International Geophysical Year. Sputnik 1 was a small, beach-ball-sized satellite that weighed only 83 kg (184 lbs) and was equipped with a radio transmitter that beeped out a continuous signal at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz. It completed one orbit of the Earth every 96.2 minutes, reaching a maximum altitude of 255 km (158 miles) and a top speed of 29,000 km/h (18,000 mph).

The development of modern rockets can be traced back to the work of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a Russian engineer and mathematician who published a paper in 1903 titled "The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices." Tsiolkovsky's work was not widely known outside of Russia at the time, but it influenced later pioneers of rocketry such as Robert H. Goddard and Hermann Oberth. Goddard, an American engineer, published a paper in 1919 titled "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes" that proposed the use of liquid fuel rockets to achieve high speeds and altitudes. He also proved in the laboratory that rockets could work in the vacuum of space, but his work was not taken seriously by the public.

The first crewed spacecraft to orbit the Earth was the Soviet Union's Vostok 1, which carried cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. Gagarin's flight marked a major milestone in the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States, and it paved the way for future human spaceflight missions. The United States' first crewed spacecraft was the Freedom 7, which was launched in 1961 and carried astronaut Alan Shepard on a sub-orbital flight to an altitude of 187 km (116 miles).

Overall, the development of modern rockets and spacecraft has been a collaborative effort by scientists and engineers from around the world, with significant contributions from pioneers such as Tsiolkovsky, Goddard, Oberth, and von Braun. Their work has enabled humanity to explore the vastness of space and to achieve incredible feats such as sending humans to the Moon and establishing permanent human presence in space.
r1: The first object in human history to reach space was a rocket launched by the Third Reich during World War II in June 1944. The first manned rocket reached space on April 12, 1961.

a: The first cellular phone was demonstrated in 1973 by Motorola, with the first commercial automated cellular network (1G) analog launching in Japan in 1979. The first handheld mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000X, was released in the US in 1983, but it was not until the launch of the second-generation (2G) digital cellular technology in Finland in 1991 that the industry saw widespread adoption. This sparked competition and innovation, leading to the development of third-generation (3G) technology in 2001, which offered higher data transfer speeds and capacity. However, as bandwidth-intensive applications such as streaming media became more popular, it became clear that 3G networks would soon be overwhelmed, leading to the development of fourth-generation (4G) technologies. Today, mobile phone subscriptions have grown to over seven billion worldwide, with smartphones representing 78% of total mobile phone sales. The advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive "generations," starting with the early zeroth-generation (0G) services, and have led to the development of feature phones and the modern smartphones we use today.

The development of the first cellular phone was a collaborative effort between various countries and companies, with the first handheld mobile phone being demonstrated by Motorola in 1973. The first commercial automated cellular network (1G) analog was launched in Japan in 1979, and the first handheld mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000X, was released in the US in 1983.

This sparked competition and innovation, leading to the development of third-generation (3G) technology in 2001, which offered higher data transfer speeds and capacity.

The growth of mobile phone subscriptions has been exponential, with worldwide subscriptions growing to over seven billion by 2014, enough to provide one for every person on Earth. Today, smartphones represent 78% of total mobile phone sales, with the top smartphone developers worldwide being Samsung, Apple, and Huawei. The advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive "generations," starting with the early zeroth-generation (0G) services, and have led to the development of feature phones and the modern smartphones we use today.

However, the development of mobile technology has not been without its challenges. The early analog cellular systems were unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping, and the first handheld mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000X, had a talk time of just thirty-five minutes and took ten hours to charge. Despite these challenges, consumer demand for mobile technology has been strong, with waiting lists for the first mobile phones reaching into the thousands. Today, mobile technology is an essential part of modern life, with smartphones offering a wide range of features and applications that have revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and live.
r1: The first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973. In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. The phone had a talk time of just thirty minutes and took ten hours to charge.

a: Pax Romana, or the Roman Peace, refers to the prolonged period of relative stability and prosperity experienced by the Roman Empire from the accession of Caesar Augustus in 27 BC to the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD. This period of approximately 206 years saw the Roman Empire reach its greatest territorial extent and a population of up to 70 million people, a third of the world's population at the time. The Pax Romana was a "miracle" in the sense that there had never been such a long period of peace in recorded history prior to this time. However, this peace was not without its challenges and the empire faced numerous internal conflicts and external threats during this period.

Despite the stability and prosperity brought about by the Pax Romana, the empire was not without its challenges. The reign of Commodus, who ruled from 180 to 192 AD, was marked by a period of dictatorial rule and the "Year of the Five Emperors," a time of political instability and conflict. This period marked the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, as described by historian Cassius Dio as a descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust." The Pax Romana is a testament to the resilience and strength of the Roman Empire, but it also highlights the fragility of even the greatest empires and the challenges they face in maintaining stability and prosperity over extended periods of time.
r1: Pax Romana is Latin for "Roman Peace." It's used to describe the roughly 200-year-long period with sustained inner hegemonial peace and stability. This timespan of Roman history is identified as a period of increased as well as sustained Roman imperialism, order, prosperous stability, and expansion, despite a number of revolts, wars and continuing competition with Parthia. During this period of time, the Roman Empire achieved its greatest territorial extent and its population reached a maximum of up to 70 million people.

a: The Indian higher education system is the third largest in the world, with a vast network of universities, colleges, and institutions offering a wide range of courses and programs. However, despite its size and growth, the system still lags behind universities such as Harvard, Cambridge, and Oxford in terms of quality and standards. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission (UGC), which enforces standards, advises the government, and coordinates between the center and the states. Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions established by the UGC.

India has 799 universities, including 44 central universities, 540 state universities, 122 deemed universities, 90 private universities, and 5 institutions established and functioning under the State Act. In addition, there are 39,071 colleges, including 1800 exclusive women's colleges, functioning under these universities and institutions. The system has expanded rapidly over the past decade, with the addition of nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students.

However, despite this growth, Indian higher education is in need of radical reforms. The system is plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, poor quality of education, and a focus on rote learning rather than critical thinking and innovation. The rise of IT sector and engineering education has boxed students into a linear path without giving them the opportunity to explore and discover their passions. Concerted and collaborative efforts are needed to broaden student choices through liberal arts education.

The history of higher education in India can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of functioning learning centers as early as 1000 B.C. These centers were primarily concerned with dispersing Vedic education. The modern Indian education system finds its roots in the colonial legacy of the British Government, which used the university system as a tool of cultural colonization. The British East India Company set up the first institution of higher learning in 1781, followed by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Benaras Sanskrit College, and Fort William College. With the Charter Act of 1813, the British Parliament officially declared Indian education as one of the duties of the state.

In conclusion, the Indian higher education system is the third largest in the world, with a vast network of universities, colleges, and institutions offering a wide range of courses and programs. However, the system still lags behind universities such as Harvard, Cambridge, and Oxford in terms of quality and standards. Radical reforms are needed to address issues such as lack of transparency, poor quality of education, and a focus on rote learning rather than critical thinking and innovation. By broadening student choices through liberal arts education and focusing on enforcing higher standards of transparency, strengthening the vocational and doctoral education pipeline, and professionalizing the sector through stronger institutional responsibility, India can reprioritize efforts and work around the complexities to provide a world-class education to its citizens.
r1: India's higher education system is the third largest in the world, after the United States and China. It's believed that Indian has ad a functioning system of higher education as early as 1000 B.C.
r2: India's higher education system is the third largest in the world, next to the United States and China.

a: The name of the tower in which Big Ben is located is the Elizabeth Tower, previously known as the Clock Tower. This information can be found on the Wikipedia page for Big Ben, which states that the tower was renamed in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The renaming of the tower was done to honor the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the throne, which was celebrated throughout 2012 with commemorative events held throughout the Commonwealth of Nations. The Elizabeth Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-gothic style and was completed in 1859. It stands tall, with a base that is square in shape, measuring on each side, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. The clock is the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world, with Big Ben being the largest of five bells and weighing over 13 tons. The origin of the bell's nickname, Big Ben, is open to question, with some attributing it to Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its installation, while others believe it may be named after the heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt. The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup.
r1: Commonly referred to as Big Ben (in reference to the large clock it displays), the tower at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in England, was recently renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012. It was formerly known just as the Clock Tower. The change in name was to mark the 60th anniversary, or the Diamond Jubilee, of Elizabeth II's accession to the throne.

a: The United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, acquiring approximately 828,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River for $15 million. This significant expansion of American territory was made possible through the efforts of President Thomas Jefferson, who had long been interested in acquiring the territory for the United States. The purchase was facilitated by the Baring family, a prominent British banking dynasty, which helped to finance the transaction and underwrite the bonds issued by the U.S. government to pay France for the territory.

The purchase of the Louisiana Territory was not without controversy, as many Federalists opposed the move, fearing that it would lead to the creation of new Western states that would be dominated by Republican politics and dilute the power of New England Federalists. Additionally, the purchase was made at a time when the United States was already facing challenges from Great Britain and Native American tribes in the region.

Despite these challenges, the Louisiana Purchase marked a significant turning point in the history of the United States, as it effectively doubled the size of the country and provided new opportunities for westward expansion. The purchase also set the stage for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which was established to explore and chart the newly acquired territory.

The Senate approved the treaty with a vote of 24 to 7, with the majority of Federalists opposing the purchase. However, President Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican Party were able to secure the necessary votes to ratify the treaty. On October 21, 1803, the Senate authorized Jefferson to take possession of the territory and establish a temporary military government.

The transfer of ownership of the territory from France to the United States took place on December 20, 1803, at the Cabildo in New Orleans, and was marked by a flag-raising ceremony. The U.S. military took control of the territory, and plans were put in place to establish a system of local government and explore the region.

Over time, the U.S. government built or expanded forts along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, including Fort Bellefontaine, Fort Armstrong, Fort Edwards, Fort Crawford, Fort Snelling, and Fort Atkinson. These forts were used to protect American interests in the region and to maintain order.

In conclusion, the Louisiana Purchase was a significant event in American history that marked the beginning of the country's westward expansion and set the stage for the growth of the United States into a major world power. The purchase was facilitated by the Baring family and was marked by controversy and challenges, but ultimately it provided new opportunities for the United States and paved the way for the country's future growth and development.
r1: The Louisiana Territory was purchased by America in 1803 through the Louisiana Purchase Treaty between the U.S. and France. The treaty was signed on April 30, 1803 at the Hôtel Tubeuf in Paris. On October 21, 1803 the Senate authorized Jefferson to take possession of the territory and establish a temporary military government.
r2: The United States, under President Thomas Jefferson, acquired the Louisiana territory from France in 1803 through the Lousiana Purchase, with the treaty signing and taking of possession on different dates. The Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed on April 30, 1803, by Robert Livingston, James Monroe, and François Barbé-Marbois. Later in the year, on October 21, 1803, the Senate authorized Jefferson to take possession of the Louisiana territory and establish a temporary military government.

a: The first person to land a ratified quadruple jump in figure skating competition was Canadian Kurt Browning in 1988. However, the quadruple jump has become increasingly common among World and Olympic level men's single skaters to the point that not having one in a program is now seen as a severe handicap. The jump had become so common that it was viewed as a deciding element in a winning program, and the lack of it almost a handicap. In fact, many skaters attempted to include the quad in their skating arsenal to remain competitive. However, the quad controversy came to a head at the Vancouver Olympic Games when Jeffrey Buttle won the World Figure Skating Championships without a quad, disproving the long-standing notion that a quad was needed to win the big titles.

The difficulty of landing a quadruple jump is evident in the fact that only two women have successfully landed a ratified quad in competition, Miki Ando being the first in 2002. The precision and skill required for a quadruple jump are immense, as even the smallest error can make the difference between success and failure. As Max Aaron, a figure skater, stated, "The minute your left arm is behind you, or your three-turn is too fast, if your hips don't turn in time, if your foot isn't in the right place, anything will throw you off." The pressure to include a quad in a program has become so great that some skaters have resorted to using a jump harness in training to perfect the jump.

Despite the challenges of landing a quadruple jump, the jump has become an essential element in men's figure skating. The fact that only two skaters have won the World Figure Skating Championships without a quad in the past twelve years, and that Jeffrey Buttle's win at the 2008 Worlds disproved the notion that a quad was needed to win the big titles, highlights the importance of the quad in modern figure skating. The quest for perfection in the quadruple jump continues to drive skaters to push the limits of what is possible, and the jump remains a defining feature of elite figure skating competition.
r1: The first person known to land a quadruple jump in figure skating was Mark Cockerell, during his trainings in 1983. He decided not to attempt these jumps during his performances, though. The first ratified quadruple jump went to Kurt Browning in the 1988 World Championships. In 2002, Miki Ando became the first woman to land this jump. She remains one of only five women to have landed a ratified quadruple jump in international competition.
r2: Mark Cockerell and Kurt Browning landed the first quad jumps in figure skating, while Miki Ando was the first woman to do so. In 1983, Cockerell landed quads in training at the US National Sports Festival but decided not to try it during his performance. In 1988, Browning became the first person to land a ratified quadruple jump in competition, while in 2002 Ando became the first woman to do so.

a: The end of Roman rule in Britain was a gradual process that occurred over several decades, marked by a series of political and military developments that ultimately led to the withdrawal of Roman troops and the establishment of post-Roman Britain. According to the wikipage "End of Roman rule in Britain," the transition began in 383 when the usurper Magnus Maximus withdrew troops from northern and western Britain, leaving local warlords in charge. This move was likely prompted by the need to address threats in other parts of the empire, such as the Visigoths' siege of Rome. The Romano-British later expelled the magistrates of the usurper Constantine III in response to his failures to protect the island, and Roman Emperor Honorius replied with the "Rescript of Honorius," effectively granting temporary self-government to Britain.

However, by the mid-6th century, the Roman Empire was unable to defend itself against external threats, and Britain was left to fend for itself. The situation was further complicated by the rise of the usurper Victor, who was elevated to "augustus" of the Western Roman Empire in either 383/384 or 387. Victor's father, Magnus Maximus, had previously risen up against the legitimate emperor Gratian and was recognized as the legitimate emperor in the west by Theodosius I. Victor's brief reign was marked by his father's invasion of Italy to depose Valentinian II, the brother and successor of the late Gratian. Theodosius eventually defeated Maximus and executed him, along with Victor, in 388.

The death of Victor and Maximus marked the end of Roman rule in Britain, as the empire was unable to recover from the internal rebellion and external threats that had weakened its defenses. The subsequent establishment of post-Roman Britain was characterized by the rise of local warlords and the emergence of new kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Essex and the Kingdom of Kent. These kingdoms were eventually united under the Heptarchy, a group of seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that ruled Britain until the 10th century. Overall, the end of Roman rule in Britain was a complex and gradual process that was marked by political and military developments that ultimately led to the establishment of post-Roman Britain.
r1: Roman rule ended in different parts of Britain at different times, and under different circumstances. In 383, the usurper Magnus Maximus (Roman emperor in the western portion of the Empire from 383 to 388) withdrew troops from northern and western Britain. Then around 410, the Romano-Britains expelled the magistrates of the usurper Constantine III.
r2: The end of Roman rule in Britain was the transition from Roman Britain to post-Roman Britain. In 383, the usurper Magnus Maximus withdrew troops from northern and western Britain, probably leaving local warlords in charge. Around 410, the Romano-Britains expelled the magistrates of the usurper Constantine III, ostensibly in response to his failures to use the Roman garrison he had stripped from Britain to protect the island. By the early 5th century, the Roman Empire could no longer defend itself against either internal rebellion or the external threat posed by Germanic tribes expanding in Western Europe. This situation and its consequences governed the eventual permanent detachment of Britain from the rest of the Empire.

a: New York became a free state in 1827, after a long history of slavery dating back to 1626 when the Dutch West India Company brought enslaved Africans to New Amsterdam, present-day New York City. The state's gradual emancipation process began in 1799, with a law that freed children born to slave mothers, but required them to serve as indentured servants until their mid-twenties. Existing slaves were not freed until July 4, 1827, when the last 2,800 enslaved individuals were emancipated. This process was the result of efforts by the New York Manumission Society, founded in 1785, and other abolitionist groups, as well as the impact of the American Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.

During the Revolutionary War, Britain negotiated separate treaties with Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic, and Spain offered to relinquish its conquests in West Florida, Menorca, and the Bahamas in exchange for Gibraltar, but these terms were refused by Britain. Instead, Britain ceded East Florida, West Florida, and Menorca to Spain, and France gained the island of Tobago in the Caribbean and Senegal in Africa. The Treaty of Paris, signed in 1784, recognized American independence and established the boundaries of the new nation.

After the war, the US government constructed Fort Montgomery in upstate New York, but it was discovered that the border with Canada was not accurately surveyed, leading to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842, which resolved the issue by leaving the border on the meandering line as surveyed. Slavery continued to exist in New York until 1827, despite efforts by the New York Manumission Society and other abolitionist groups. Sojourner Truth, a famous abolitionist and former slave, was born in 1797 and held as a slave in the Hudson Valley until she escaped in 1826.

Overall, the history of New York's transition to a free state was shaped by a combination of factors, including the American Revolution, the Treaty of Paris, and the efforts of abolitionist groups like the New York Manumission Society. While slavery persisted in the state for many years after the Revolution, the gradual emancipation process and eventual abolition of slavery in 1827 marked an important milestone in the state's history.
r1: New York become a free state by adopting its constitution in April 1777 and New York become a free state due to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783. The state passed a 1799 law for gradual abolition, and by July 4, 1827 all remaining slaves were finally freed.

a: The Hollywood Walk of Fame has a unique history, and one of its most interesting aspects is the fee that must be paid by those who wish to receive a star. In 1980, the Walk of Fame's creator, Johnny Grant, introduced a fee of $2,500 for each star, payable by the person or entity nominating the recipient. This fee was instituted to fund the Walk of Fame's upkeep and minimize the taxpayer burden. Over time, the fee has increased incrementally, reaching $15,000 in 2002 and $30,000 in 2012. As of 2017, the current fee is $40,000.

Grant's innovative approach to funding the Walk of Fame through nomination fees has had a significant impact on its success. By requiring recipients to personally attend their star's unveiling ceremony, Grant was able to generate publicity and encourage international press coverage. This helped to revitalize the Walk of Fame, which was struggling to recover from a period of decline in the 1970s.

Grant's contributions to the Walk of Fame extend beyond his role as creator and fundraiser. He was also a dedicated advocate for the Walk, hosting the majority of unveiling ceremonies during his tenure as chairman of the Selection Committee and Honorary Mayor of Hollywood. His unique special-category star, with its stylized "Great Seal of the City of Hollywood" emblem, is located at the entrance to the Dolby Theatre adjacent to Johnny Grant Way.

In conclusion, the fee for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has evolved over time, from $2,500 in 1980 to $40,000 in 2017. This fee, along with Grant's innovative approach to funding and promoting the Walk, has played a significant role in its success and enduring popularity.

a: According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the percentage of Australia's population that is foreign born has been steadily increasing over the past few decades. In 2019, the foreign-born population in Australia accounted for approximately 28.6% of the total population, which is an increase from 21.7% in 2006. This means that one in every four Australians was either born overseas or has at least one parent who was born overseas. The highest percentage of foreign-born residents in Australia can be found in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne, with 35.4% and 33.9% of the population, respectively, being foreign-born. The top five countries of birth for foreign-born Australians are China, India, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and Italy. This demographic shift towards a more diverse and multicultural population has brought significant economic, social, and cultural benefits to Australia, including increased trade, investment, and tourism, as well as enriched cultural and artistic expression. However, it also presents challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and integration issues, which the Australian government and society as a whole must address to ensure the well-being and success of all residents, regardless of their background.

a: The clear and present danger test, which was established in the 1919 case of Schenck v. United States, was replaced in 1969 by the imminent lawless action test in the case of Brandenburg v. Ohio. The clear and present danger test was a standard used to determine the constitutionality of limits on First Amendment rights, and it was based on the idea that speech that posed a clear and present danger to society could be restricted. However, the test was criticized for being overly broad and vague, and it was replaced by the imminent lawless action test, which requires that speech must be likely to cause imminent lawless action in order to be restricted.

The imminent lawless action test refined the clear and present danger test by focusing on the likelihood of immediate harm, rather than the potential for future harm. This change in the legal standard was a response to concerns that the clear and present danger test was too broad and could be used to restrict a wide range of speech that was not actually harmful. The imminent lawless action test has been used in a number of cases since its introduction, and it has been interpreted to allow for the restriction of speech that is likely to cause immediate harm, such as inciting violence or causing a breach of the peace.

Despite the replacement of the clear and present danger test, the bad tendency test, which was rooted in English common law, remains a relevant legal standard in the United States. The bad tendency test permits speech to be outlawed if it has a tendency to harm public welfare. However, the Supreme Court has limited the application of the bad tendency test in recent years, and it is now primarily used in cases involving obscenity and defamation.

Overall, the evolution of the legal standard for restricting First Amendment rights has been shaped by changing societal values and concerns about the potential harm that speech can cause. The clear and present danger test was replaced by the imminent lawless action test in order to provide a more nuanced and balanced approach to regulating speech, and the bad tendency test remains a relevant standard in certain contexts.
r1: "Clear and present danger" was a test adopted by the Supreme Court to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, or assembly. The "clear and present danger" was replaced in 1969 by "Brandenburg v. Ohio", and the test refined to determining whether the speech would provoke an "imminent lawless action".
r2: Clear and present danger was a doctrine adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, or assembly.

a: During World War II, a total of 1,056,841 African American registrants were inducted into the United States armed forces through Selective Service, accounting for approximately 11% of all registrants liable for service. Of these, 141,294 African Americans were inducted during the period of July 1, 1944 - December 31, 1945, comprising 9.6% of all inductions. Despite making up a significant proportion of inductees, African Americans were disproportionately represented in certain branches of the military, with the Army being the primary branch where they served.

The Tuskegee Airmen, the 761st Tank Battalion, and the 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion were among the famous segregated units that proved their value in combat, leading to the desegregation of all U.S. armed forces by President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981 in July 1948. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. served as the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen during the war and later became the first African-American general in the United States Air Force. Other notable African American servicemen during World War II included Doris Miller, who was the first African-American recipient of the Navy Cross, and Samuel L. Gravely, Jr., who became the first African American to command a U.S. warship and the first to be an admiral.

The contributions of African American soldiers during World War II were significant and paved the way for future generations of African Americans in the military. Their bravery and sacrifice, despite facing discrimination and segregation, helped to break down racial barriers and prove the value of diversity in the armed forces. Today, their legacy continues to be celebrated and honored, serving as a reminder of the importance of equality and inclusivity in the military and society as a whole.

a: The term that refers to linking a currency value to the value of gold is "gold standard." A gold standard is a monetary system in which a region's common medium of exchange is paper notes that are normally freely convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold. The standard specifies how the gold backing would be implemented, including the amount of specie per currency unit. Under a gold standard, the currency itself has no "innate value," but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed for the equivalent specie. This system is different from a fixed exchange rate, where a currency's value is fixed against the value of another single currency or a basket of currencies, but is not backed by gold.

The gold standard has been used in the past as a way to stabilize currency values and control inflation. For example, many countries in South America reverted to a gold standard in the later part of the 20th century as part of an attempt to control inflation. However, the gold standard has also been criticized for limiting the ability of governments to use domestic monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic stability. Under the Bretton Woods agreement, most countries around the world had currencies that were fixed to the U.S. dollar, which limited inflation in those countries but also exposed them to the danger of speculative attacks.

In conclusion, the gold standard is a monetary system that links a currency's value to the value of gold, and it has been used in the past as a way to stabilize currency values and control inflation. However, it has also been criticized for limiting the ability of governments to use domestic monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic stability.
r1: A fixed exchange rate, sometimes called a pegged exchange rate, is a type of exchange rate where a currency's value is fixed against the value of another currency, or another measure of value, such as gold. A "gold exchange standard" refers to when a government guarantees a fixed exchange rate, not to a specified amount of gold, but to the currency of another country that uses a gold standard.
r2: "Gold standard" is the term that refers to linking a currency's value to only the value of gold, while "fixed exchange rate" is the term that refers to linking it to the value of gold or to another currency or basket of currencies. A fixed exchange rate is also sometimes called a pegged exchange rate.

a: The lyrics to the hit musical film "The Greatest Showman" were written by the songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, collectively known as Pasek and Paul. The film's soundtrack, which features original songs by the duo, was widely praised for its catchy melodies and heartfelt lyrics. Pasek and Paul's work on "The Greatest Showman" was particularly notable for its ability to seamlessly blend contemporary pop sensibilities with traditional musical theater styles, creating a sound that was both nostalgic and modern.

Pasek and Paul's collaboration on "The Greatest Showman" was a result of their long-standing partnership, which began when they were freshmen at the University of Michigan. The two musicians had originally met as background performers in a school musical production, and they soon began working together on their own material. Over the years, they honed their craft, writing a series of songs that eventually became the basis for their first musical, "Edges." The success of "Edges" led to opportunities to work on larger projects, including "Dear Evan Hansen," for which they won the Tony Award for Best Original Score.

Despite their success, Pasek and Paul faced criticism for the artistic liberties they took in adapting the story of P.T. Barnum's life for the screen. Some reviewers felt that the film's portrayal of Barnum was overly sanitized and shallow, failing to capture the complexity and nuance of the historical figure's life. However, the duo's ability to craft infectious, show-stopping songs that resonated with audiences was widely praised, and their work on "The Greatest Showman" helped to solidify their reputation as two of the most talented songwriters in the musical theater world.
r1: Benj Pasek and Justin Paul or just referred to as their last names, Pasek and Paul, wrote the lyrics to the song The Greatest Showman from the musical drama film by the same name.

a: The New International Version (NIV) of the Bible was first published in 1978 by Biblica, with the New Testament released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978. The project was initiated in 1956 by a small committee of biblical scholars from the Christian Reformed Church, the National Association of Evangelicals, and a group of international scholars.

Additionally, an "easy-reader" version called the New International Reader's Version (NIrV) was published in 1996, written at a third-grade reading level. The NIV has become one of the most popular and best-selling modern translations, with editions published by Zondervan in the United States and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK.

a: The capital of Virginia was moved from Williamsburg to Richmond in 1780, during the American Revolutionary War. This decision was made by Governor Thomas Jefferson, who urged the legislature to relocate the capital to a more central and secure location, away from the coastal city of Williamsburg, which was vulnerable to British attack. The Virginia General Assembly adjourned on December 24, 1779, and reconvened in Richmond on May 1, 1780, meeting in a makeshift building near Shockoe Bottom. The decision to move the capital was motivated by the need for a more secure and central location, as well as the desire to distance the state government from the coastal city, which was seen as vulnerable to British attack.

The Virginia State Capitol in Richmond was designed by Thomas Jefferson, together with French architect Charles-Louis Clérisseau, and was inspired by the Maison Carrée at Nîmes in southern France, an ancient Roman temple. The building was constructed between 1785 and 1792, and is one of only twelve Capitols in the United States without an external dome. It served as the capital of the Confederacy during the American Civil War, and is now a National Historic Landmark and a symbol of Virginia's rich history and heritage.

Williamsburg, the previous capital of Virginia, was founded in 1632 as Middle Plantation, a fortified settlement on high ground between the James and York rivers. The city served as the capital of the Colony and Commonwealth of Virginia from 1699 to 1780, and was the center of political events in Virginia leading to the American Revolution. Today, Williamsburg is a popular tourist destination, known for its restored Historic Area and its association with the College of William & Mary, which was established in 1693 and is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.

a: Sure! Here's the comprehensive answer to the question "When do Riley and Danny get together in Baby Daddy?"

In the ABC Family sitcom Baby Daddy, Riley and Danny do not get together as they are portrayed as two separate characters with different storylines throughout the series. Danny (played by Derek Theler) is Ben's older brother and a successful businessman, while Riley (played by Chelsea Kane) is one of Ben's best friends and a aspiring artist. While they share some moments of friendship and camaraderie, there is no romantic relationship between Riley and Danny in the show.

Throughout the series' six seasons, Riley is portrayed as a love interest for Ben (played by Jean-Luc Bilodeau), and their on-again, off-again relationship is a central plot point in the show. Danny, on the other hand, has a few romantic relationships with different characters, but none of them are with Riley.

Therefore, to answer the question, Riley and Danny do not get together in Baby Daddy. Instead, the show focuses on the adventures and challenges of Ben and his friends as they navigate single parenthood, relationships, and young adulthood in New York City.
r1: In the American sitcom Baby Daddy, Riley and Danny end up together in Season 5 episode 1. And in Season 5 episode 20 they get serious after finding out Riley is pregnant. The couple later gets married in Season 6 episode 8.

a: The War on Poverty was a policy and slogan used during the Great Society era of the 1960s, aimed at eliminating poverty and racial injustice in the United States. President Lyndon B. Johnson first introduced the term in his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964, as a response to the high poverty rate of around 19% at the time. The Economic Opportunity Act was passed soon after, establishing the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administer federal funds targeted against poverty. As part of the Great Society, Johnson believed in expanding the federal government's roles in education and healthcare as poverty reduction strategies. These policies built upon the New Deal and Four Freedoms of Franklin D. Roosevelt and continued with the efforts of John F. Kennedy's New Frontier.

The War on Poverty led to the creation of programs such as Head Start, VISTA, TRiO, and Job Corps, which continue to exist today. However, the policy faced challenges in the 1980s and 1990s due to deregulation, criticism of the welfare state, and a shift towards reducing federal aid to impoverished people. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, signed by President Bill Clinton, marked a significant change in the approach to poverty reduction, shifting the focus towards personal responsibility and work requirements. Despite these changes, the legacy of the War on Poverty remains in the continued existence of these federal programs and the ongoing efforts to address poverty and inequality in the United States.

a: The triangular shaped area at each end of a Greek temple is called a pediment. The pediment is a significant feature of ancient Greek architecture and is often the most important location for monumental sculpture on the exterior of the building. The pediment is framed by the cornice, which is the upper band of the entablature, and is typically decorated with sculptural decoration. The entablature, which is the superstructure of moldings and bands that lies horizontally above columns, is a major element of classical architecture and is divided into the architrave, frieze, and cornice. The proportions of the subdivisions of the entablature are defined by the proportions of the column in the order, and in classical Greek and Roman temples, the pediment is often approximately a quarter of the height of the column. The pediment is supported by the stylobate, which is the masonry base of the temple, and is often decorated with sculptural decoration, such as reliefs or statues, that reflect the religious or mythological themes of the temple. In medieval French architecture, the tympanum is often supported by a decorated pillar called a "trumeau".
r1: Greek temples have multiple triangular shapes. The triangular decorative surface on the each end of Greek temples are called tympanon. And at the front and rear of each temple, the entablature which is the structure that lies horizontally above columns, supports a triangular structure called the "pediment".

a: The Jeep Wrangler, known for its rugged and versatile design, has a rich history that spans over four decades. The first Wrangler was introduced in 1986, based on a new set of design parameters that differentiated it from the previous CJ-7 model. The Wrangler YJ, as it was called, featured a wider track, improved suspension, and a more comfortable and handling-focused design. Over the years, the Wrangler has undergone several revisions and redesigns, with the third-generation JK model being introduced in 2006. This model marked a significant shift in the Wrangler's design, with the addition of a four-door "Unlimited" model that offered more room and comfort.

The four-door Wrangler Unlimited proved to be a highly successful model, with three quarters of all new Wranglers sold being the four-door variant by mid-2017. This shift towards four-door models can be attributed to the changing preferences of consumers, who are increasingly looking for vehicles that offer more space and practicality without sacrificing the iconic Wrangler's off-road capabilities.

The Jeep Wrangler's success can be attributed to its ability to balance rugged capability with modern comfort and technology. The latest fourth-generation JL model, introduced in 2018, features a host of new features such as easier fold-flat windshield and soft top designs, a more modern interior, and additional powertrains. The Wrangler's enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless design and the brand's commitment to delivering a vehicle that can handle any terrain, whether on or off the road.

a: Most of your taste buds are located on your tongue, specifically on raised protrusions called papillae. There are three types of papillae that contain taste buds: fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate. The fungiform papillae are found on the front and back of the tongue and contain taste buds that detect sweet, salty, and sour tastes. The foliate papillae are found on the back of the tongue and contain taste buds that detect bitter tastes. The circumvallate papillae are found on the back of the tongue near the entrance to the throat and contain taste buds that detect umami tastes. However, it's important to note that the tongue does not have specific areas for specific tastes, as a popular myth suggests. Instead, all areas of the tongue can detect all five tastes, and the taste receptors are distributed throughout the tongue. The taste receptors are located on top of the taste buds, which are clusters of cells that contain specialized receptors and ion channels. These receptors and channels transmit information about the taste of food to the brain through the seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves. On average, the human tongue has 2,000-8,000 taste buds, and they play a crucial role in our ability to experience and enjoy the flavors of food and drink.
r1: Papillae, commonly referred to as taste buds, are small structures on the upper surface of the tongue. They are also found on the soft palate, the upper esophagus, the cheeks, and on the epiglottis. Taste buds contain taste receptor cells involved in detecting saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness and umami.
r2: The taste buds on the tongue sit on raised protrusions on the tongue surface, small structures known as papillae. Taste buds contain the taste receptor cells, which are located around the papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, cheek, and epiglottis.

The opening of the popular 1970s-80s sitcom "Three's Company" was filmed at two different locations. The first, seventh, and eighth seasons were taped at Metromedia Square and ABC Television Center, while the second through sixth seasons were taped in Studio 31 at CBS Television City. The show's cast would receive the script on Monday, rehearse from Tuesday to Thursday, and shoot on Friday, with each episode being shot twice in a row using a multicamera setup of three cameras. The taping was done in sequence, and the producers were strict, as Priscilla Barnes once noted that they were "very, very controlling" and that her hair had to be just right, or she would be called into the office.

The scenes in the opening credits featuring the trio frolicking on a boardwalk and riding bumper cars were shot at the Santa Monica Pier before a larger amusement park was built adjacent to the pier. A later opening sequence featuring the new threesome and other cast members riding a zoo tram and looking at various animals around the zoo was filmed at the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park.

Interestingly, when Priscilla Barnes joined the show in the sixth season, she was given opening-credits billing, while her predecessor, Jenilee Harrison, was end-credits billed and appeared less frequently in the series.

a: The process that releases nitrogen gas into the atmosphere is denitrification, which is carried out by facultatively anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic conditions, such as waterlogged soils. These bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration, producing nitrogen gas (N2) as a byproduct. This process is an important part of the nitrogen cycle, as it converts nitrate (NO3-) into nitrogen gas, making it unavailable to plants. The denitrifying bacteria compete with nitrate-ammonifying bacteria for nitrate in the environment, but while the latter process conserves bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium, denitrification releases nitrogen gas into the atmosphere. This process is particularly significant in the oceans, where it makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion. The balanced formula for this process, known as anammox, is: NH + NO → N + 2HO (ΔG° = -217 kJ/mol).
r1: The nitrogen cycle takes place in the atmosphere, on land and in aquatic environments. The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The last process, denitrification, is the part of the cycle that actually releases nitrogen gas (N) back into the atmosphere.
r2: The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates among atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is atmosphere nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. Denitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N), and back into the atmosphere, completing the nitrogen cycle.

Cartwright was an American character actress who had a long career in film and television, with smaller roles in movies such as "Black Patch" and "The Wasp Woman." She was also involved with the Group Repertory Theatre in Burbank, California.

The film, directed by Penny Marshall, tells a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) and stars Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, and Lori Petty. The screenplay was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel from a story by Kelly Candaele and Kim Wilson. The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2012, and it is considered culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.

In the film, Dottie Hinson (played by Geena Davis) attends the opening of the new All-American Girls Professional Baseball League exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame, which prompts a flashback to 1943. The film follows the story of the women's league, which was created during World War II when Major League Baseball was threatened to be shut down. The league was bankrolled by candy magnate and Cubs owner Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall) and was run by Ira Lowenstein (David Strathairn) with the help of Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz).

Dottie Green, a real-life professional baseball catcher for the Rockford Peaches in the AAGPBL from 1943 to 1947, was not the inspiration for Geena Davis's character, Dottie Hinson. However, Green was one of the 60 original founding players of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in 1943 and was known for her strong arm and deep knowledge of the game. She committed only 55 errors in 1355 total chances for a sterling .957 career fielding average and was a championship team member in 1945.

In conclusion, Lynn Cartwright played the older version of Dottie Hinson in the 1992 film "A League of Their Own," which tells a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry and is considered culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Dottie Green, a real-life professional baseball catcher for the Rockford Peaches, was not the inspiration for Geena Davis's character, but she was one of the founding players of the AAGPBL and had a successful career in the league.

a: Of the many talented players to have graced the NBA courts over the years, only a select few have achieved the remarkable feat of scoring 60 points in a single game. This elite group includes some of the greatest players in NBA history, such as Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant.

One notable example of a player who scored 60 points in a game is Mitch Taylor, who achieved this feat during his time at Southern University in 1994. Taylor, who played college basketball before transferring to the professional ranks, made 12 three-pointers in a single game, a record that has been included in the official National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball record book. This impressive performance earned him a place in the record books alongside some of the greatest players in NBA history.

However, it is worth noting that scoring 60 points in a game is a rare achievement, even for the most talented players. In fact, according to the NBA, there have been only 15 instances of players scoring 60 points or more in a single game since the league's inception. This elite group includes some of the greatest players in NBA history, such as Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 60 points in a game on March 2, 1962, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who achieved this feat on April 7, 1971.

Moreover, the 1986 NBA Playoffs saw Michael Jordan put on a record-setting performance in Game 2 of the Bulls' first-round series against the Celtics, scoring 63 points in a 2-OT loss. This performance still stands as the NBA Playoff scoring record, and it marked the beginning of Jordan's rise to superstardom.

In conclusion, scoring 60 points in a game is an achievement that only the most talented and skilled players in NBA history have been able to accomplish. From Mitch Taylor's impressive performance in college to Michael Jordan's record-setting game in the 1986 NBA Playoffs, this feat is a testament to the incredible athleticism and dedication required to excel at the highest level of professional basketball.

a: The statue of Zeus at Olympia was destroyed in the 5th century AD, with its exact date of destruction unknown. According to Roman historian Suetonius, the statue was one of the famous statues of the gods that were brought from Greece to Rome by the emperor Caligula, but before this could happen, Caligula was assassinated in 41 AD. The statue was then spared, but the temple and the statue were eventually destroyed in a fire in 425 AD or 475 AD, as recorded by the 11th-century Byzantine historian Georgios Kedrenos. The statue was made of ivory plates and gold panels over a wooden framework, and it was commissioned by the Eleans in the latter half of the 5th century BC for their recently constructed Temple of Zeus. The statue was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but no copy of it has ever been found, and details of its form are known only from ancient Greek descriptions and representations on coins.

The factoids provided in the context of the question offer additional information about the statue's history and fate. According to Lucian of Samosata, the statue was damaged or destroyed in the 2nd century AD, but the exact date is not known. Archaeological finds from Phidias' workshop, where the statue was made, have confirmed the approximate date of the statue's creation in the third quarter of the 5th century BC. The cup inscribed with Phidias' name and found at the site also supports the theory that the statue was created by Phidias.

Overall, the statue of Zeus at Olympia was a magnificent work of art that was lost and destroyed in the 5th century AD, and its exact date of destruction remains unknown. Despite the lack of a surviving copy, the statue's legacy lives on through ancient Greek descriptions and representations on coins, offering a glimpse into the artistic and cultural achievements of the ancient world.
r1: How the statue of Zeus at Olympia was destroyed is unknown, but there are many thoughts on how this could have happened. It was approximately destroyed around the 5th century AD, but earlier loss or damage is implied by Lucian of Samosata in the later 2nd century. According to the Byzantine historian Georgios Kedrenos, the statue of zeus at olympia was destroyed the great fire of the Palace of Lausus, in 475 AD. Alternatively, the statue perished along with the temple, which was severely damaged by fire in 425 AD.
r2: The statue of Zeus at Olympia was destroyed in approximately the 5th century AD, though Lucian of Samosata implied it was in the later 2nd century. According to Byzantine historian Georgios Kedrenos, it was destroyed in the great fire of the Palace of Lausus in 475 AD. Alternatively, if it was destroyed along with the temple when the temple was severely damaged by fire, it was destroyed in 425 AD.

a: Ragtime flourished in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, specifically between 1895 and 1918. This musical style, characterized by its syncopated or "ragged" rhythm, originated in African-American communities in cities such as St. Louis. Ernest Hogan, a pioneer of ragtime, was the first composer to have his works published as sheet music, beginning with the song "La Pas Ma La" in 1895. Ben Harney, another Kentucky native, helped popularize the style with his composition "You've Been a Good Old Wagon But You Done Broke Down," published in 1896. Ragtime was a modification of the march style popularized by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms derived from African music.

The peak of ragtime's popularity was marked by the publication of Scott Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag" in 1899, which heavily influenced subsequent composers and became a hit. Joplin's subsequent works, such as "The Entertainer" (1902), cemented his status as a leading figure in the genre. However, ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public's imagination after 1917, and it was largely forgotten until the 1940s and 1950s, when revivals of the style began to take place. These revivals saw the release of new recordings and the rediscovery of ragtime compositions from the past, including Joplin's work. In 1971, Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Joplin's work, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. The New England Ragtime Ensemble, then a student group, recorded "The Red Back Book," a compilation of Joplin's rags in period orchestrations, in 1973.

Overall, ragtime flourished in the United States for over two decades, leaving a lasting impact on American music and influencing the development of jazz and other musical styles. Its resurgence in popularity during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1970s is a testament to its enduring appeal and the timelessness of its unique sound.
r1: The musical style ragtime, flourished and peaked popularity in the united states between 1895 and 1919. But in the early 1970s, there was a major ragtime revival.
r2: In the United States, ragtime has flourished at different times, with numerous revivals having occurred since newer styles supplanted ragtime in the 1920s. Ragtime first flourished and reached peak popularity in the US between 1895 and 1919. By the start of the 20th century, it had become widely popular throughout North America, enjoyed by people of many different subcultures. Ragtime flourished again in the US in revivals in the 1940s and 1950s, followed by a major revival in the early 1970s.

a: Based on the factoid context provided, the religion with the highest population in Africa is Christianity. According to the World Book Encyclopedia, in 2002, Christians formed 40% of the continent's population, with Muslims forming 45%. It was also estimated that Christians form 45% of Africa's population, with Muslims forming 40.6%. Christianity is now one of the most widely practiced religions in Africa, along with Islam, and is the largest religion in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most adherents outside Egypt, Ethiopia, and Eritrea are Roman Catholic or Protestant.

It is worth noting that while Christianity has the highest population in Africa, many Africans practice a combination of their traditional beliefs and Abrahamic religions, such as Christianity and Islam. This blending of religions is a common phenomenon in Africa, and it reflects the diverse cultural and religious heritage of the continent. Additionally, African traditional religions, such as those practiced by the Serer of Senegal, the Yoruba and Igbo of Nigeria, and the Akan of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, continue to play an important role in the religious landscape of Africa.

Overall, the religious diversity of Africa is a reflection of the continent's rich cultural heritage and its long history of religious exchange and interaction. While Christianity has the highest population, it is important to recognize the importance of other religions and belief systems in Africa, and to respect the diverse religious traditions and practices of the continent's peoples.
r1: The World Book Encyclopedia has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 40% of the continent's population, with Muslims forming 45%. It was also estimated in 2002 that Christians form 45% of Africa's population, with Muslims forming 40.6%.
r2: Religion in Africa is multifaceted and has been a major influence on art, culture and philosophy. Today, the continent's various populations and individuals are mostly adherents of Christianity, Islam, and to a lesser extent several traditional African religions.

a: The question asks where the highest temperatures on Earth have been recorded, and provides a factoid about the WMO decertifying the previous record holder, 'Aziziya, Libya, in 2012. The factoid also mentions that temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30-50 degrees Celsius, and that the theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90-100 degrees Celsius.

In response to the question, it can be stated that the highest recorded air temperature on Earth is currently held by Death Valley, California, with a reading of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius) on July 10, 1913. However, this record is disputed by some weather historians, who argue that the reading may have been influenced by a sandstorm and is not an accurate representation of the true air temperature. If this record were to be decertified, the next highest recorded air temperature would be 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius), recorded in both Death Valley on June 20, 2013, and in Mitribah, Kuwait on July 21, 2016.

It is important to note that temperature measurements taken directly on the ground may be significantly higher than air temperatures, due to the fact that the ground absorbs and retains heat more than the air. The highest recorded ground temperature is allegedly 93.9 degrees Celsius (201 degrees Fahrenheit), recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch on July 15, 1972. However, this reading is not considered to be an official record by the WMO.

Satellite measurements of ground temperature have also recorded extremely high temperatures, with the highest recorded temperature being 70.7 degrees Celsius (159.3 degrees Fahrenheit), recorded in the Lut Desert, Iran in 2005. The Lut Desert has also been found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured between 2003 and 2009.

In conclusion, while the highest recorded air temperature on Earth is currently held by Death Valley, California, there is some debate about the accuracy of this reading. If decertified, the next highest recorded air temperature would be from Death Valley in 2013, or from Mitribah, Kuwait in 2016. However, ground temperatures measured directly may be significantly higher than air temperatures, and satellite measurements have recorded even higher temperatures in certain locations.
r1: The highest temprature on Earth is recorded by three different ways, by air, ground, and via satellite observation, with air being the most accurate. The highest ground and air temperature recorded on Earth was at Furnace Creek Ranch, California in the Death Valley desert. While, the highest temperature on Earth recorded via satellite was of Lut Desert, Iran.
r2: The standard measuring conditions for temperature are in the air, 1.5 meters above the ground, and shielded from direct sunlight. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the highest registered air temperature on Earth was 56.7 °C (134.1 °F) in Furnace Creek Ranch, California, located in the Death Valley desert in the United States, on July 10, 1913, but the validity of this record is challenged. Other satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009 found a maximum temperature of 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert, Iran.

a: The United States was taken off the gold standard in 1933, during the Great Depression, as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies. The gold standard, which linked the value of currency to the value of gold, had been in place since the late 19th century, but it was abandoned by many countries, including the United States, during the Great Depression. The Bank of England was one of the first to abandon the gold standard in 1931, and other countries soon followed, as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the solvency of their monetary systems. In the United States, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to protect the gold standard, but this only worsened domestic economic pressures.

In early 1933, the United States faced severe deflation, bank runs, and hoarding of gold coins, which led to a crisis in the monetary system. To address these issues, Congress and President Roosevelt implemented a series of Acts of Congress and Executive Orders, including Executive Order 6073, the Emergency Banking Act, Executive Order 6102, and the Gold Reserve Act. These actions suspended the gold standard for the US dollar, revoked gold as universal legal tender for debts, and banned private ownership of significant amounts of gold coin. The Supreme Court upheld these actions in the "Gold Clause Cases" in 1935.

President Roosevelt's decision to take the United States off the gold standard in April 1933 was a significant departure from the traditional gold standard, and it allowed him to pursue inflationary policies to address the economic crisis. The United States' departure from the gold standard was also a key factor in the development of the Bretton Woods system, which established the US dollar as a global reserve currency and created the modern international monetary order.

In 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency. This action, known as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the US dollar became a reserve currency used by many states, while many fixed currencies became free-floating. The political basis for the Bretton Woods system was the shared experiences of two World Wars and the concentration of power in a small number of states, which facilitated the decisions reached by the Bretton Woods Conference.
r1: America was taken off the gold standard, but still allowed foreign governments to trade dollars for gold in 1933. In 1944, with the the Bretton Woods system, America started using the gold exchange standard. On 15 August 1971, the United States brought the Bretton Woods system to an end, ending the convertibility of the US dollar to gold.
r2: The Gold Standard Act of the United States was passed in 1900 and established gold as the only standard for redeeming paper money, stopping bimetallism (which had allowed silver in exchange for gold). During the Great Depression, every major currency abandoned the gold standard. On April 19, 1933, the United States domestically abandoned the gold standard, but still allowed foreign governments to trade dollars for gold. The 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement led to the US adopting the gold exchange standard. On August 15, 1971, Nixon issued Executive Order 11615, which "closed the gold window", making the dollar inconvertible to gold directly, except on the open market.

It is small, light, and portable, making it a popular instrument in music education, especially in Asia. The modern form of the instrument was invented by Hohner in the 1950s, but similar instruments have been known in Italy since the 19th century. The melodica has been used in a variety of musical genres, including classical, jazz, and popular music, and has been associated with musicians such as Steve Reich, Hermeto Pascoal, and Augustus Pablo.
r1: Mouth organs are a type of instrument that's played by blowing into a chamber or holes in the instrument, and blowing or sucking air to create a sound.

The Melodica is a free-reed instrument similar to the pump organ and harmonica. It has a musical keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece attached to the instrument. The modern form of the instrument was invented by Hohner in the 1950s, though similar instruments have been known in Italy since the 19th century. The Claviola was designed in the 1960s, also by Hohner, and designer Ernst Zacharias. The instrument was produced for a few months in the 1990s before being discontinued. It's similar to a melodica, but worn like an accordion, the claviola has a set of piano keys on the right side that range 2½ octaves.

a: The establishment of the State of Israel can be traced back to the end of the British Mandate for Palestine in 1948, when most of the land called Palestine became the country of Israel. Prior to this, the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organization, had been transforming into an army and successfully consolidating its hold on a continuous strip of territory including the Coastal Plain, the Jezreel Valley, and the Jordan Valley. This show of strength and capability persuaded the United States and other nations to support the Jewish community and its aspirations for a state. The victory over the Palestinian Arabs in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War not only gave the Haganah the experience and self-confidence to confront invading Arab armies but also solidified the Jewish presence in the region. On April 12, 1948, the Arab League announced that Arab armies would enter Palestine to rescue it, but this attempt was ultimately unsuccessful. The establishment of the State of Israel marked the beginning of a long and complex history of conflict and negotiation with neighboring countries and the Palestinian people, who were displaced and lost their homeland as a result of the creation of the new state.
r1: The parts of Palestine became the country of Israel with Israel's declaration of independence on 14 May 1948 with more of the land becoming a part of the country on 10 March 1949, at the end of the Arab-Israeli war.
r2: Israel, officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in Western Asia. Most of the land called Palestine became the country of Israel when Israel declared its independence on 14 May 1948. This also occurred with the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict on 10 March 1949.

a: In the Netflix series "Orange Is the New Black," Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) is the protagonist and central character, based on the real-life Piper Kerman, who wrote the memoir "Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison" (2010) upon which the series is based. The show explores Chapman's experiences in a women's prison, delving into themes of identity, power dynamics, and the complexities of the criminal justice system.

Chapman's backstory, as revealed throughout the series, is one of privilege and naivety. Born into a wealthy family in Boston, she attended Smith College and became involved in a relationship with an international drug smuggler, Catherine Cleary Wolters. At the age of 24, Chapman flew a suitcase of money from the United States to Belgium for a West African drug lord, as part of her girlfriend's drug trafficking operation. Five years later, she was named as part of the drug ring and eventually pleaded guilty, serving 13 months in a Danbury, Connecticut women's prison, FCI Danbury.

The series begins with Chapman's arrival at Litchfield Federal Penitentiary, where she is sent after being convicted of a crime she committed 10 years prior. She is initially portrayed as a privileged and entitled character, struggling to adapt to the harsh realities of prison life. However, as the series progresses, Chapman's character evolves and she becomes more empathetic towards her fellow inmates, many of whom are struggling with their own personal demons and traumas.

One of the central conflicts of the series is Chapman's relationship with her girlfriend, Alex Vause, played by Laura Prepon. Vause is based on Wolters, the real-life drug smuggler who Chapman met in 1991.

a: The first helicopter to be made and flown was the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, designed by Henrich Focke and flown by Hanna Reitsch on June 26, 1936, in the Deutschland Hall Stadium in Germany. This achievement came after Focke was inspired by Juan de la Cierva's autogyros and designed the world's first practical helicopter. However, Focke was ousted from the Focke-Wulf company shortly after, and the Air Ministry took over the company and issued him with a requirement for an improved helicopter design.

Prior to the Fw 61, there were several other inventors and engineers who experimented with helicopter designs, including Edison, Bahýľ, and the French brothers Jacques and Louis Breguet. Edison built a helicopter using a gasoline engine and box kites attached to a mast, but it never flew. Bahýľ's helicopter reached a height of in 1901 and flew for over , while the Gyroplane No. 1 designed by the French brothers lifted its pilot into the air for a minute in 1907. Cornu's helicopter used two counter-rotating rotors driven by an Antoinette engine and achieved a height of nearly , but it proved to be unstable and was abandoned.

The Fw 61 was a significant milestone in helicopter design and development, as it was the first helicopter to use a single main rotor and a tail rotor for stability. It had a maximum speed of 25 mph and a range of 20 miles. Although the Fw 61 was not widely produced or used during World War II, it paved the way for modern helicopter designs and inspired further innovation in the field.

In summary, the first helicopter to be made and flown was the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, designed by Henrich Focke and flown by Hanna Reitsch in 1936. However, other inventors and engineers had experimented with helicopter designs before, including Edison, Bahýľ, and the French brothers. The Fw 61 was a significant milestone in helicopter design and development, and it laid the foundation for modern helicopter technology.
r1: The first helicopter was created in 1861 by the French inventor, Gustave de Ponton d'Amécourt. However, his model never took flight. The Italian engineer, Enrico Forlanini, build an unmanned version of the helicopter in 1878 that rose to a height of 12 meters (39 feet), where it hovered for about 20 seconds after a vertical take-off. The first helicopter model to carry a pilot was in 1907. Two French brothers, Jacques and Louis Breguet, built the "Gyroplane No.1" sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907. It lifted its pilot 2 ft into the air for about a minute. The Gyroplane No.1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady. On 13 November 1907, another French inventor, Paul Cornu, designed and built the Cornu helicopter. It lifted its inventor off the ground and remained aloft for 20 seconds. Even though this flight did not surpass in height the flight of the Gyroplane No. 1, it was reported to be the first truly free flight with a pilot as it did not need to be held steady. Almost three decades later, German aviation pioneer and co-founder of the Focke-Wulf company, invented the Fw 61. This was the world's first practical transverse twin-rotor helicopter. It first flew on 26 June 1936 to more than 8,000 feet (2,400 m) at speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). A few years later, on 11 December 1951, turbine engines started being used in helicopters. This meant the helicopter could fly with a large amount of power and a low weight penalty.
r2: There are a number of helicopters, including twin-rotor, turbine-powered, manned, and truly free helicopters. The first helicopter was made in 1861, while the first helicopter flew in 1878. The first manned helicopter was made and flown at a height of 2 ft for 1 minute in 1907, and the first truly free helicopter was made and flown with a pilot on 13 November 1907. The first transverse twin-rotor helicopter was made and successfully flown on 26 June 1936, and the first turbine-powered helicopter was made and flown on 11 December 1951.

a: In the live-action remake of Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," the song "Evermore" is a pivotal moment in the Beast's character development and emotional journey. The song is performed by the Beast, played by Dan Stevens, as he releases Belle from the castle and accepts that she will be leaving him forever. The Beast's powerful and emotional rendition of the song highlights the changes he has undergone throughout the film, as he has learned to love and accept himself for who he is.

According to Tracy Goldman of "The Cornell Daily Sun," the song "adds more depth to the character" by "highlighting the changes he goes through throughout the movie." The Beast's performance of "Evermore" serves as a culmination of his personal and emotional journeys, as he comes to terms with the fact that he has lost the one he loves and must accept the consequences of his actions. The song also provides the Beast with "a stronger voice," allowing him to express his emotions and vulnerabilities in a way that he could not before.

The inclusion of "Evermore" in the film was a deliberate choice made by the filmmakers to provide a more nuanced and complex portrayal of the Beast's character. In the original animated film, the Beast barely sings, and the film's three-act structure provided an opportunity for the character to have a more substantial musical moment. The decision to include an entirely new song, rather than using one of the Beast's songs from the stage adaptation, allowed the filmmakers to create a moment that was specifically tailored to the live-action remake and the character's development.

Overall, "Evermore" is a poignant and emotional moment in the live-action remake of "Beauty and the Beast," serving as a culmination of the Beast's character development and providing a deeper understanding of his emotional journey. The song's inclusion in the film highlights the filmmakers' commitment to providing a more nuanced and complex portrayal of the Beast's character, and the song's powerful and emotional performance by Dan Stevens further underscores the Beast's growth and transformation throughout the film.
r1: The song Evermore in the live action 2017 American musical romantic fantasy film, Beauty and the Beast, is sung by Beast played by Dan Stevens.

a: The three types of enzymes involved in digestion are lipases, trypsin, and enterokinase. Lipases are responsible for breaking down triglycerides into smaller monoglyceride units, while trypsin cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids. Enterokinase activates trypsinogen into trypsin, allowing it to perform its digestive functions. These enzymes play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and protein digestion, respectively.

Lipases are secreted by the pancreas and are responsible for breaking down triglycerides into smaller monoglyceride units. This process begins in the mouth, where lingual lipase continues the chemical digestion of fats that began in the stomach. The majority of lipid digestion and absorption occurs in the small intestines, where pancreatic lipase and bile salt-dependent lipase break down triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. These fatty acids are then absorbed into the small intestine's epithelial cells.

Trypsin, on the other hand, is responsible for cleaving peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids. It is activated by enterokinase, which is produced by the mucosa of the duodenum. Trypsin is released by the pancreas and works in conjunction with other enzymes to break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.

Enterokinase is a key enzyme in the digestive process, as it activates trypsinogen into trypsin. This allows trypsin to perform its digestive functions, cleaving peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids. Enterokinase is produced by the mucosa of the duodenum and is specific to the small intestine, making it an essential component of the digestive process.

In conclusion, the three types of enzymes involved in digestion are lipases, trypsin, and enterokinase. These enzymes play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and protein digestion, respectively. Lipases break down triglycerides into smaller monoglyceride units, while trypsin cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids. Enterokinase activates trypsinogen into trypsin, allowing it to perform its digestive functions. These enzymes work together to ensure proper digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine.
r1: Digestive enzymes are classified by the substance they breakdown. The main four types are, lipases, proteases, amylases, and nucleases. The first, lipase, is produced in the mouth and helps break down fatty acids in food. Protease breaks down protein. It's found in the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine in mammal and other higher vertebrates. Amylase is also produced in the mouth. It's secreted by the salivary glands. This enzyme is great at breaking down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. The last digestive enzyme, nuclease, can be found in the pancreatic juice. Nuclease helps the body break down nucleic acids, like DNAase and RNAase, in the food one consumes.
r2: Digestive enzymes are a group of enzymes that break down polymeric macromolecules into their smaller building blocks, in order to facilitate their absorption by the body. Lipases split fatty acids off of fats and oils. Proteases and peptidases split proteins into small peptides and amino acids. Amylases split carbohydrates such as starch and sugars into simple sugars such as glucose. Nucleases split nucleic acids into nucleotides.

a: A simple gear train can be found in a wind turbine, specifically in the gearless or direct drive configuration. In this design, the rotor shaft is directly connected to the generator, eliminating the need for a gearbox. This simplifies the system and reduces the risk of reliability issues and maintenance costs associated with the gearbox. The direct drive generator uses permanent magnets to generate electricity, which are attached to the rotor and spin at the same speed as the blades. This design allows for increased efficiency, reduced noise, and a longer lifetime compared to traditional gear-based wind turbines. To compensate for the slower spinning rate of the direct drive generator, the rotor diameter is larger, providing more magnets to generate the required power and frequency. While gearless wind turbines are often heavier than gear-based turbines, the benefits of increased efficiency and reliability make them an attractive option for wind energy production.

The concept of gear trains can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with examples found in the Antikythera mechanism of Greece and the south-pointing chariot of China. The involute tooth design was later developed, providing a standard gear design that ensures a constant speed ratio. Gears and gear trains are characterized by the meshing of teeth on two or more gears, which transmit torque and change the speed and direction of a power source. The velocity of the point of contact on the pitch circles is the same on both gears, and the gear ratio can be computed based on the radii of the pitch circles and the number of teeth on each gear. Gears can be found in a variety of devices, including transmissions, bicycles, motorcycles, and cars, where they are used to produce a mechanical advantage and change the speed and torque of the power source.
r1: A gear train is a mechanical system formed by mounting gears on a frame with rotating, interlocking teeth. The gears can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source, and are considered a simple machine. Gear trains are used in a variety of machines, and are typically found in the gearbox, which is a form of a simple transmission. You can also find a gear train on non-motorized machines, such a bicycle.
r2: A transmission is a machine in a power transmission system, which provides controlled application of power. Often the term 5-speed transmission refers simply to the gearbox, that uses gears and gear trains to provide speed and torque block conversions from a rotating power source to another device. Simple gear trains are often found in gearboxes on machines as well as on non-motorized bicycles.

a: Here's the comprehensive answer to your question:

When was soccer first introduced in the Olympics?

Soccer, or association football, was first introduced in the Olympics at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. However, it was not an official Olympic sport at that time, and the tournament was not recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC considers the 1900 and 1904 tournaments to be official Olympic events, but they are not recognized by FIFA. The first official Olympic soccer tournament was held at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, which was organized by the Football Association. Women's soccer was added to the Olympic program in 1996, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, featured the sixth edition of the women's tournament.

The history of soccer in the Olympics is complex and has evolved over time. Although soccer was not included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, there is evidence that an unofficial tournament was organized during the games, with a team representing Athens losing to a team from Smyrna (now part of Turkey). The sport has since grown in popularity and has become one of the most popular team sports in the world. Today, soccer is played by both men and women at the Olympic Games, with the women's tournament featuring 12 teams at the 2016 Games.

It is worth noting that there are different forms of football, including association football (soccer), gridiron football (American football), Australian rules football, rugby football, and Gaelic football. Each of these variations has its own set of rules and is popular in different regions of the world. The history of soccer in the Olympics is specific to the association football version of the sport.
r1: Soccer, most globally known as football, was first introduced to the Olympic Games in 1900. However, only men's teams were allowed to compete until 1996. The United States women's team won the 1996 tournament after a 2–1 victory against China in the gold medal game.
r2: Soccer, also known as football or association football, was first introduced in the Olympics in 1900 and in 1996. Men's soccer was introduced at the Olympics in 1900 and has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Women's soccer was first introduced at the Olympics in 1996 at the 1996 Atlanta Games.

a: The game of cricket in India can be traced back to the British Raj, specifically to the East India Company, which was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I on December 31, 1600. The company was established to trade in the Indian Ocean region, including Mughal India and the East Indies, and later became involved in governance and military functions. As the East India Company's influence grew in India, so did the popularity of cricket among the native population. The company's trading settlements in Madras (founded in 1639), Bombay (acquired in 1661), and Calcutta (established in 1690) became leading centers of cricket.

The introduction of cricket in India was largely due to the British officers and soldiers who were stationed in the country. They introduced the game to the local population, who quickly took to it, and it became a popular pastime among the British and the native Indians. The game was initially played in the compounds of the East India Company's trading settlements, but soon spread to other parts of the country.

The popularity of cricket in India grew rapidly, and by the mid-19th century, it had become a popular sport throughout the country. The first cricket club in India, the Calcutta Cricket Club, was established in 1792, and the first international cricket match was played between India and England in 1864. The East India Company's involvement in cricket was not limited to just introducing the game to India, but also to other parts of the world, including the East Indies and China.

In conclusion, the game of cricket in India was introduced by the British East India Company, which brought the game to the country as part of its trade and governance activities. The popularity of cricket among the native population grew rapidly, and it soon became a popular sport throughout the country. The East India Company's involvement in cricket was instrumental in the game's development and growth in India, and it played a significant role in shaping the sport's history in the country.
r1: The English game of cricket was introduced in India when trade with Britain was established by The East India Company. In time, the East India Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one which virtually ruled India as it acquired auxiliary governmental and military functions. English influence and culture found at trading posts became leading centers of cricket as the popularity of the game grew among the native population.
r2: Sailors and traders of the East India Company initiated the game of cricket in India and did so through trading. The East India Company was an English, and later British, joint-stock company founded in 1600 and was the means by which cricket was introduced into India.

a: Here's the comprehensive answer to the question:

The song "God Bless America" has a rich history that dates back to World War I. The song was written by Irving Berlin in 1918 while he was serving in the U.S. Army at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York. However, the song was initially set aside as it didn't fit in a revue called "Yip Yip Yaphank." The original version of the song had different lyrics, including the line "Make her victorious on land and foam, God bless America..." and "Stand beside her and guide her to the right with the light from above."

The song was later revised by Berlin in 1938, ahead of World War II, and it became a patriotic anthem for the United States. The revised version, which is the one commonly known today, takes the form of a prayer for God's blessing and peace for the nation. The song has been recorded by many artists, including Kate Smith, who made it her signature song.

Interestingly, music critic Jody Rosen has pointed out that a 1906 Jewish dialect novelty song, "When Mose with His Nose Leads the Band," contains a six-note fragment that is "instantly recognizable as the opening strains of 'God Bless America.'" This suggests that the melody of "God Bless America" may have been influenced by earlier Jewish music.

Overall, "God Bless America" is a beloved patriotic song that has been a part of American culture for over a century. Its origins can be traced back to World War I and the early 20th century Jewish music, and its revised version has become a symbol of American patriotism and a prayer for peace and blessings for the nation.
r1: "God Bless America" is an American patriotic song written by Irving Berlin during World War I in 1918 and revised by him in the run up to World War II in 1938. Originally the song was supposed to be performed at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York.
r2: God Bless America was written by Irving Berlin during World War I and was originally supposed to be performed at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York.

a: The Virginia Plan, proposed by James Madison and officially presented by Edmund Randolph at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, aimed to establish a strong national government with a bicameral legislature. The plan called for a legislative branch consisting of two houses: the lower house would be composed of members elected directly by the people, while the upper house would be composed of members chosen by state legislatures. This proposed structure gave more power to the larger states, as they would have a greater number of representatives in the lower house based on their population. However, the plan also provided for a check on the power of the larger states by giving each state an equal number of representatives in the upper house.

The Connecticut Compromise, reached later in the convention, modified the Virginia Plan by retaining the bicameral legislature but altering the representation in the upper house. Each state would have two representatives in the upper house, regardless of its population. This compromise allowed for a balance between the interests of large and small states, as both would have an equal number of representatives in the upper house.

Overall, the Virginia Plan and the Connecticut Compromise gave more power to the larger states in the legislative branch of the national government, as they would have a greater number of representatives in the lower house based on their population. However, the compromise also ensured that smaller states had a voice in the upper house, preventing the larger states from dominating the government. This balance of power was a key aspect of the Constitution and has continued to shape the government of the United States to this day.
r1: The Virginia Plan which proposed the creation of a supreme national government with three branches and a bicameral legislature, gave more power to larger states, additionally the plan proposed that the legislative branch would have the power to veto state laws.
r2: The Virginia Plan, also known as the Randolph Plan, after its sponsor, or the Large-State Plan, was a proposal to the United States Constitutional Convention for the creation of a supreme national government with three branches and a bicameral legislature. This would provide large states, like Virginia, more representation than they had under the Articles of Confederation, which gave each state equal representation regardless of population. For this reason, the plan was called the "large-state plan". Additionally, the plan proposed that the legislative branch would have the power to veto state laws if they were deemed incompatible with the articles of union, or the states were deemed incompetent.

a: The Amazon River, the largest river in the world by discharge volume, has a complex and disputed origin. For nearly a century, the most distant source of the Amazon was believed to be in the Apurímac river drainage, with the snowcapped Nevado Mismi peak in Peru considered the most distant source. However, a 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in the journal "Area" challenged this long-held belief, instead identifying the most distant source of the Amazon as being in the Río Mantaro drainage.

The study used a variety of methods to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river and the Apurímac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing that the Mantaro river is significantly longer than previously thought. The most accurate measurements were obtained by direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers, which revealed that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin and, therefore, in the entire Amazon basin. This finding means that the Amazon river is approximately 80 kilometers longer than previously thought, with its source located nearly 80 kilometers farther upstream than the previously identified source in the Apurímac drainage.

The Amazon river is formed by the confluence of several rivers, including the Rio Negro, which is the largest left tributary of the Amazon and the largest blackwater river in the world. The Rio Negro rises in Colombia and flows in an east-northeasterly direction through the Puinawai National Reserve, passing several small indigenous settlements before forming the border between Colombia and Venezuela. The river then turns southwest and receives the Casiquiare canal from the right-hand, forming a unique link between the Orinoco and the Amazon river basin.

Daming the Amazon river could potentially bring about the "end of free-flowing rivers" and contribute to an "ecosystem collapse" that will cause major social problems, highlighting the importance of preserving this vital waterway and its surrounding ecosystem. Understanding the true source of the Amazon river is crucial for effective river management and conservation efforts, as well as for ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of this vital resource.
r1: The Amazon River, located in South America, is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world. It is also one of the world's longest rivers. For nearly a century, the start and end of the river was considered to be the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi and Atlantic Ocean. However, a 2014 study identified the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the Río Mantaro, located in the central region of Peru. This means the Amazon River starts and ends in the Mantaro River and Atlantic Ocean, respectively.
r2: The Amazon River in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and the disputed longest river in the world. The Amazon River starts and ends at the Mantaro River and Atlantic Ocean. The Mantaro River, or Río Mantaro, runs through Huancayo Province in Peru. It is commonly believed that the Amazon River started and finished at the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi and Atlantic Ocean. The mouth of the Amazon River is in Brazil at the Atlantic Ocean.

However, Sauron secretly forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, transferring most of his power into it. As soon as he put it on, the elves became aware of his ruse and removed their Three Rings, which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron's aid. Sauron waged war on the elves, conquering much of Middle-earth and killing Celebrimbor, leading to the Dark Years when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings and corrupted many of the dwarves and men. Only a few individuals, including Bilbo, Frodo, and Samwise, were able to resist the power of the Ring and ultimately destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom.

a: Based on the information provided in the factoids, it is difficult to definitively say who the best golfer in the world is, as there have been several players who have held the number one ranking in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) over the years. However, we can analyze the trends and patterns in the rankings to gain some insights.

Firstly, it is notable that there have been several players who have held the number one ranking for a significant amount of time, including Greg Norman, Tiger Woods, and Dustin Johnson. These players have demonstrated a high level of consistency and excellence in their performances, which suggests that they may be among the best golfers in the world.

However, it is also worth noting that the OWGR is based on a two-year rolling system, which means that players can accumulate points from events that took place over the past two years. This can lead to situations where a player who has not won a major championship in the past year can still be ranked number one if they have accumulated a significant number of points from previous events.

Furthermore, the OWGR also takes into account the strength of the field in each event, which can affect a player's ranking. For example, a player who wins a major championship against a strong field may be ranked higher than a player who wins a less prestigious event against a weaker field.

In terms of nationality, the top 100 players in the OWGR are representative of several countries, with the United States, England, and Australia being the most represented. This suggests that there is no one dominant country in golf, and that the best golfers come from a variety of backgrounds.

Finally, it is worth noting that the OWGR is not the only measure of a golfer's skill and success. Other factors, such as major championship victories and Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup performances, can also be used to evaluate a player's abilities.

In conclusion, while there have been several players who have held the number one ranking in the OWGR, it is difficult to definitively say who the best golfer in the world is. The OWGR is just one measure of a golfer's skill and success, and there are many factors that can influence a player's ranking.

a: The music for the iconic film "The Bridge on the River Kwai" was composed by British composer Malcolm Arnold, who had only ten days to write around forty-five minutes of music for the film. Despite the tight deadline, Arnold's score was a critical and commercial success, and it won him an Academy Award for Best Original Score. The score features a memorable march, "The River Kwai March," which is accompanied by the whistling of the Colonel Bogey strain. The film's use of music is notable for its effectiveness in enhancing the emotional impact of the film's dramatic scenes, such as the famous bridge explosion sequence. In contrast to the film's sweeping orchestral score, many scenes feature only the sounds of nature, emphasizing the tension and desperation of the characters. The film's use of music and sound is a testament to the skill of its composers and the power of music to enhance the emotional impact of a film.

The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 British-American epic war film directed by David Lean and based on the novel "Le Pont de la Rivière Kwaï" (1952) by Pierre Boulle. The film's historical setting is the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942-1943, and it features an all-star cast including William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness, and Sessue Hayakawa. The film was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson. The film's success was not without controversy, as it was criticized for its historical inaccuracies and its portrayal of the conditions endured by the prisoners of war who built the Burma Railway. Despite these criticisms, the film was widely praised and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, at the 30th Academy Awards. It has since been deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress.

a: In the beloved children's novel "Charlotte's Web," the pig named Wilbur is the central character and the focus of the story. Wilbur is a runt pig who is saved by a little girl named Fern and raised as a pet on her father's farm. When Wilbur is sent to her uncle's barnyard, he is befriended by a wise and resourceful barn spider named Charlotte. As Wilbur faces the threat of being slaughtered, Charlotte devises a plan to save his life by weaving words of praise for Wilbur into her web, making him a local celebrity and convincing the farmer to spare his life.

The story of "Charlotte's Web" has been praised for its timeless themes of friendship, compassion, and the power of words. The novel's dry, low-key style, as described by E.B. White, adds to its charm and accessibility for both children and adults. The description of the experience of swinging on a rope swing at the farm is a notable example of rhythm in writing, as the pace of the sentences reflects the motion of the swing. The novel has been adapted into several films, including an animated feature in 1973 and a live-action film in 2006, as well as a video game in 2006.

Despite its classic status, "Charlotte's Web" has not been without criticism. Some reviewers have noted that the story's depiction of farm life and animal characters can be seen as idyllic and sanitized, glossing over the harsh realities of industrial farming and the treatment of animals in such systems. Additionally, some have criticized the story's focus on the human characters, particularly Fern, at the expense of the animal characters, such as Wilbur and Charlotte.

Overall, "Charlotte's Web" remains a beloved and enduring children's classic, with its themes of friendship, compassion, and the power of words continuing to resonate with readers of all ages.

a: In 1989, the Oakland Athletics, led by manager Tony La Russa, swept the San Francisco Giants in the World Series, winning the series 4-0. This was the first World Series sweep since 1976 and marked the fourth time in World Series history that a team never trailed in any game. The Athletics, who were managed by La Russa in his first year with the team, won the American League West division and then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. The Giants, managed by Dusty Baker, won the National League West division and then defeated the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series.

The 1989 World Series was notable for being played during a time of great turmoil in the Bay Area. Just before the series began, a devastating earthquake struck the Loma Prieta region, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The earthquake forced the cancellation of Game 3, which was scheduled to be played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The series resumed with Game 4, which was played at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.

Despite the challenges posed by the earthquake and the disruption to the series, the Athletics played some of the best baseball of their lives, winning all four games of the series. The team's dominant performance was led by pitchers Dave Stewart, Mike Moore, and Dennis Eckersley, who combined to throw a shutout in Game 2 and allowed only one run in the final three games. The Athletics' offense was led by Mark McGwire, who hit .385 with two home runs and five RBIs in the series.

The 1989 World Series was also notable for the respectful manner in which the Athletics chose not to celebrate their victory. Out of respect for the victims of the earthquake, the team decided not to pour champagne on each other after the final game, as is customary for the winning team in the World Series. Instead, the team held a low-key celebration in their clubhouse.

Overall, the 1989 World Series was a remarkable achievement for the Oakland Athletics, who overcame incredible adversity to win the championship.

a: The name of the river in Salzburg, Austria is the Salzach River. The Salzach River is a right tributary of the Inn River and flows through the Austrian state of Salzburg, as well as a small portion of Germany, before joining the Danube River. The river is approximately 225 kilometers long and has a drainage basin that covers large parts of the Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps. The river's name is derived from the German word "Salz" meaning "salt" and "Aach" meaning "stream". Historically, the river was an important transportation route for shipping salt, which was a vital commodity in the local economy. However, with the construction of the parallel Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line in the 19th century, the river's significance as a transportation route declined. Today, the Salzach River is the main river in the Austrian state of Salzburg and is known for its picturesque scenery and white water rapids.

The Taugl River, also known as the Tauglbach, is a tributary of the Salzach River. It rises near the Gennerhorn peak in the Kitzbühel Alps and flows south to north through the Hintersee before emptying into the Salzach River. The Taugl River is classified as a dangerous white water river and is popular for rafting and other water sports.

The Fischach River is another tributary of the Salzach River, flowing through the town of Bergheim before joining the Salzach.

a: The landmark Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education took place in Topeka, Kansas, in 1954. The case was brought by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on behalf of Oliver Brown, a African American father who sought to enroll his daughter in a white-only elementary school. The case challenged the constitutionality of state laws that established separate public schools for black and white students, and it effectively overturned the "Plessy v. Ferguson" decision of 1896, which allowed for state-sponsored segregation in public education. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision, delivered on May 17, 1954, declared that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal" and violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory for the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not provide a clear method for ending racial segregation in schools, and it was followed by the Court's second decision in "Brown II" which only ordered states to desegregate "with all deliberate speed." For much of the sixty years preceding the "Brown" case, race relations in the United States had been dominated by racial segregation.
r1: Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court's unanimous (9–0) decision stated that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal", and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

a: The biggest gold nugget ever found was the Welcome Nugget, discovered in 1858 in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It weighed an impressive 2,217 troy ounces (68.98 kg) and was roughly shaped like a horse's head. The nugget was found in the roof of a tunnel 55 meters underground by a group of twenty-two Cornish miners. Despite being eclipsed by the discovery of the larger Welcome Stranger eleven years later, the Welcome Nugget remains the second largest gold nugget ever found. The extreme variability in gold size and distribution, known as the "nugget effect," has made gold exploration in the Goldboro mineralized belts of Nova Scotia, Canada, a challenging endeavor. However, the successful mining of narrow quartz vein gold deposits in Australia, similar to those in Nova Scotia, demonstrates that low-grade concentrations of gold can be mined as economically viable deposits. The Samira Hill Gold Mine in Niger, Africa, is expected to produce 135,000 troy ounces of gold in its first year of operation, with a mine life of six years and estimated reserves of 10,073,626 tons at an average grade of 2.21 grams per ton. The mine's ore processing involves crushing, grinding, and carbon leaching, and it is expected to recover 618,000 troy ounces of gold over its six-year mine life. The Koma Bangou deposit, located within the Samira Horizon gold belt, is estimated to contain 315,000 ounces of gold in reserves.
r1: Gold nuggets of various sizes have been found throughout the world. Two gold nuggets are claimed as the largest in the world, with the first one being the Welcome Stranger. Considered by most authorities to be the biggest gold nugget ever found, it was found at Moliagul, Victoria, Australia in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates, and weighed in at 214.15 pounds. The second one, the Canaã nugget, was found in the State of Para, Brazil, and is the largest surviving natural nugget on record weighing in at 156.6 pounds. In the United States, the largest nugget ever found was in Sierra Buttes, California, and weighed 109.2 pounds.
r2: Most authorities consider the Welcome Stranger to be the biggest gold nugget ever found, measuring 24 by 12 in and weighing 97.14 kilograms. It was found in 1869 in Moliagul, Victoria, Australia, and is also the biggest gold nugget ever found in Australia. The biggest gold nugget found in Brazil was found in the State of Para.

a: During World War II, the United States fought against three main Axis powers: Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war began for the United States on December 7, 1941, with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan, which led to the United States' formal entry into the conflict. Prior to this, the United States had maintained a policy of neutrality, while still providing military aid to Britain, the Soviet Union, and China through the Lend-Lease Act. The U.S. military played a significant role in the war, particularly in the Pacific Theater, where U.S. forces replaced British invasion forces in Iceland and engaged in early combat activities such as those carried out by the Flying Tigers.

The U.S. military was led by key civilian advisors to President Roosevelt, including Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who mobilized the nation's industries and induction centers to supply the Army, and General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest King, who commanded the Army and Navy, respectively. The U.S. military suffered significant losses during the war, with over 405,000 killed in action and 671,000 wounded. Additionally, 130,000 American prisoners of war were taken, of whom 116,000 returned home after the war.

The U.S. fought against Germany and Italy in Europe and North Africa, and against Japan in the Pacific. The war in Europe saw a series of defeats for Germany, including the siege of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kursk. In December 1941, Germany declared war on the United States after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The Allied Forces, including the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, eventually gained the upper hand and defeated Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war in Europe ended in May 1945, with Germany's surrender, and the war in the Pacific ended in September 1945, with Japan's surrender following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing between 50 and 80 million deaths, with the majority being civilians. The war was also marked by systematic genocide, including the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of six million Jews and millions of others deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime. The United States' involvement in World War II had a profound impact on the country's economy, society, and politics, and helped to shape the world as we know it today.
r1: The history of the United States in World War II covers the victorious American war against the Axis Powers, starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The main 3 countries that the United States fought against were in the Tripartite Pact, which included Germany, Italy, and Japan.

a: The type of cell that contributes to the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system (CNS) is the endothelial cell. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of specialized endothelial cells that form tight junctions, restricting the passage of solutes from the bloodstream into the CNS. These tight junctions are composed of transmembrane proteins such as occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), and ESAM, which are anchored into the endothelial cells by protein complexes that include ZO-1 and associated proteins. The BBB is unique compared to other capillaries in the body, as it is composed of high-density cells that restrict the passage of substances more effectively. Additionally, astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to these cells. The BBB is distinct from other barriers in the CNS, such as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which is formed by choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and the blood-retinal barrier, which is a part of the whole realm of such barriers.
r1: The blood-brain barrier is composed of high-density cells restricting passage of substances from the bloodstream much more than do the endothelial cells in capillaries elsewhere in the body. Astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet (also known as "glia limitans") surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to those cells.
r2: The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system where neurons reside.

a: The history of personal computers as mass-market consumer electronic devices began in the 1980s with the microcomputer revolution. Prior to this time, computers were primarily mainframe systems or single-user minicomputers that were too expensive and complex for individual consumers. The first personal computer was the IBM Personal Computer, launched in 1981, which popularized the term "Personal Computer" and coined the abbreviation "PC." Early personal computers were sold in electronic kit form and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. However, with the introduction of the Altair 8800 in 1975, the first commercially successful personal computer, the industry began to take off. The Altair spawned an entire industry of clones and add-on kits, and the market for personal computers grew rapidly. By 1979, over half a million microcomputers had been sold, and the youth of the day had a new concept of the personal computer. The introduction of the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 further solidified the concept of the personal computer as a mass-market consumer electronic device, and the market for PCs has continued to grow and evolve since then.

The history of personal computers can be traced back to the development of the microprocessor, which made it possible to produce individual computers that were low enough in cost to be affordable for individual consumers. The first personal computer, the Altair 8800, was sold in kit form and was relatively difficult to use, requiring machine language programs to be entered by hand via front-panel switches. However, the success of the Altair spawned an entire industry of clones and add-on kits, and the market for personal computers grew rapidly.

The IBM Personal Computer, launched in 1981, was a significant milestone in the history of personal computers. It popularized the term "Personal Computer" and coined the abbreviation "PC." The IBM PC was designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, and it quickly became a bestseller. The success of the IBM PC helped to solidify the concept of the personal computer as a mass-market consumer electronic device, and the market for PCs has continued to grow and evolve since then.

In conclusion, the history of personal computers as mass-market consumer electronic devices began in the 1980s with the microcomputer revolution. The Altair 8800 was the first commercially successful personal computer, and the IBM Personal Computer further solidified the concept of the personal computer as a mass-market consumer electronic device. The market for personal computers has continued to grow and evolve since then, with advances in technology and decreasing costs making personal computers more accessible and user-friendly for individuals.
r1: The history of the personal computer as a mass-market consumer electronic device began with the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s. In 1968, a manufacturer took the risk of referring to their product as a "personal computer", when Hewlett-Packard advertised their "Powerful Computing Genie" as "The New Hewlett-Packard 9100A personal computer". The Altair was introduced in a "Popular Electronics" magazine article in the January 1975 issue. In keeping with MITS's earlier projects, the Altair was sold in kit form, although a relatively complex one consisting of four circuit boards and many parts. In 1977, three new pre-assembled small computers hit the markets which "Byte" would refer to as the "1977 Trinity" of personal computing. The Apple II and the PET 2001 were advertised as "personal computers", while the TRS-80 was described as a microcomputer used for household tasks including ""personal" financial management".
r2: Kits and preassembled versions of personal computers were introduced at different times, while other products were marketed as personal computers prior to actual personal computers being sold. Hewlett-Packard had the first product marketed to the public as a personal computer in 1968 when they referred to one of their programmable calculators in ads as "The New Hewlett-Packard 9100A personal computer," but they later changed the ad. The first actual personal computer sold to the public, in kit form in 1975, was the Altair 8800. In 1977, the first pre-assembled small computers were sold to the public, the Apple II, the PET 2001, and the TRS-80.

a: Galvanized metals have been covered with a thin sheet of zinc to prevent rusting, a process known as galvanization. The most common method of galvanization is hot-dip galvanizing, where the metal parts are submerged in a bath of molten zinc. This process protects the underlying steel or iron in several ways, including providing a physical barrier against corrosion, sacrificing the zinc coating to prevent the steel from corroding, and reacting with the steel to form a protective layer of zinc oxide. The use of zinc coatings has been widely adopted due to its effectiveness in extending the lifespan of metal structures and reducing maintenance costs. The term "galvanized" has also been used metaphorically to describe any stimulus that results in activity, as the original application of the term in scientific research and medical practice referred to the stimulation of muscles by electric current. The history of galvanization can be traced back to the 17th century, with the earliest known example of galvanized iron encountered by Europeans on Indian armor in the Royal Armouries Museum collection. Over time, the term "galvanizing" has come to be associated almost exclusively with zinc coatings, and has become a widely recognized and widely adopted method of protecting metal structures from corrosion.
r1: Galvanization is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting. The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, in which the parts are submerged in a bath of molten hot zinc iron alloys.
r2: Galvanization or galvanizing is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting. The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, which deposits a thick, robust layer of zinc iron alloys on the surface of a steel item.

a: The Shema is found in the Torah in three separate sections: Va'etchanan (Deuteronomy 3:23-7:11), Eikev (Deuteronomy 7:12-11:25), and Shlach (Numbers 13:1-15:41). These sections are read in the weekly Torah portions corresponding to each section. The Shema is a central prayer in Jewish tradition and is recited twice daily, in the morning and evening prayers. The Shema is a declaration of faith in one God, and it is considered the most important part of the prayer service in Judaism. The first verse of the Shema, "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4), is a declaration of the oneness of God and is considered a fundamental principle of Jewish faith. The recitation of the Shema is a mitzvah, or religious commandment, and is considered a central aspect of Jewish practice. The Shema is also recited as a person's last words before death, and parents are encouraged to teach their children to recite it before they go to sleep at night. The Shema is a powerful expression of Jewish faith and unity, and it continues to be an important part of Jewish tradition and practice to this day.
r1: Shema Yisrael is a Jewish prayer, and is also the first two words of a section of the Torah.

a: Elizabeth Loftus is a prominent pioneer in the field of eye witness research, who has made significant contributions to the understanding of the malleability of human memory and the limitations of eyewitness testimony. Building upon the work of Hugo Münsterberg, who was one of the first psychologists to question the reliability of eyewitness accounts, Loftus has conducted extensive research on the factors that can influence memory and lead to false or inaccurate recall.

Loftus' work has focused particularly on the concept of the "misinformation effect," which refers to the way in which exposure to false or misleading information can alter an individual's memory of an event. She has demonstrated through numerous studies that even seemingly innocuous information, such as the presence of a leading question or the presence of a witness, can significantly alter an individual's memory of an event.

In addition to her research on the misinformation effect, Loftus has also studied the creation and nature of false memories, including recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her work in this area has been controversial, as it has challenged the validity of such memories and raised questions about the reliability of memory in general.

Loftus' contributions to the field of eye witness research have been widely recognized, and she has been ranked as one of the most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century. Her work has had a significant impact on the legal system, and she has consulted or provided expert witness testimony for hundreds of cases.

Hugo Münsterberg, another pioneer in the field of eye witness research, was one of the first psychologists to question the reliability of eyewitness accounts. His work, which was published in the early 20th century, challenged the long-held belief that eyewitness testimony was a credible and reliable form of evidence. Münsterberg's research demonstrated that eyewitness accounts could be influenced by a variety of factors, including the witness's own biases and expectations, and that memories could be distorted or altered over time.

Despite the significant contributions of Münsterberg and Loftus, the reliability of eyewitness testimony remains a contentious issue in the legal system. However, the work of these pioneers has helped to shed light on the limitations of eyewitness testimony and has led to the development of new techniques and strategies for evaluating the reliability of eyewitness accounts.
r1: Eyewitness testimony is the account a bystander or victim gives in the courtroom, describing what that person observed that occurred during the specific incident under investigation. It's a topic that is researched, and psychologists have probed the reliability of eyewitness testimony since the beginning of the 20th century. Elizabeth F. Loftus is an American cognitive psychologist and expert on human memory, and is known for her pioneering of research in the field. Another prominent pioneer from the early 20th century was German-American psychologist Hugo Münsterberg, whose controversial book "On the Witness Stand" demonstrated the fallibility of eyewitness accounts, but met with fierce criticism, particularly in legal circles.
r2: There have been several pioneers in the field of eyewitness research. A female pioneer in the field was Elizabeth Loftus, an American cognitive psychologist and expert on human memory.

a: After the death of Qutub ud Din Aibak in 1210, the Delhi Sultanate was plunged into a power struggle, with several factions vying for control. Iltutmish, who had been appointed Governor of Badaun by Aibak, was invited by a group of noblemen to stake his claim on the Indian dominions of the Ghurids. Despite facing challenges from Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, Ali Mardan Khilji, and Taj al-Din Yildiz, Iltutmish was able to consolidate his power and ascend to the throne of Delhi.

Iltutmish's rise to power was marked by a series of conquests and brutal executions of opposition, as he sought to assert his authority and maintain control over the Delhi Sultanate. He faced challenges from both internal and external forces, as the Ghurid dominions in India had divided into four following Aibak's death, with Lahore being contested by Iltutmish, Qabacha, and Yildiz. Yildiz, who asserted his rights as the successor to Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori in Ghazni, posed a significant threat to Iltutmish's rule.

Despite these challenges, Iltutmish was able to maintain his power and establish a strong foundation for the Delhi Sultanate. He was the first ruler of the Mamluk dynasty, which was founded by Qutb al-Din Aibak and marked by a series of slave-rulers. Iltutmish's reign saw the consolidation of Muslim rule in India, as well as the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate's territories through military campaigns and the subjugation of local kingdoms.

Overall, Iltutmish's ascension to the throne of Delhi marked a significant turning point in the history of the Delhi Sultanate, as he established a strong and stable regime that would last for centuries to come. His reign set the stage for the growth and development of the Sultanate, and his legacy would be remembered as a foundational figure in the history of Islamic rule in India.
r1: Qutb al-Din Aibak was a general of the Ghurid king Muhammad Ghori, and was in-charge of the Ghurid territories in northern India. After Muhammad Ghori death, he became the ruler of an independent kingdom that evolved into the Delhi Sultanate ruled by the Mamluk dynasty. After his death, Aram Shah ascended the throne temporarily, becoming the second sultan of the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. However, his ruling soon came to an end when Shams ud-Din Iltutmish dethroned the unpopular successor in 1211, and set up his capital at Delhi.

a: In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang (or yīnyáng) represents the idea that seemingly opposite or contrary forces are actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world. This concept is often depicted in the taijitu symbol, which shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section. According to Taoist metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, as well as other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; therefore, the duality of yin and yang is considered an indivisible whole. In contrast, Confucianism attaches a moral dimension to the idea of yin and yang, with "yin" representing the "shady side" and "yang" representing the "sunny side."

The Chinese terms "yin" and "yang" are analyzable in terms of their etymology, meanings, topography, and loanwords. The Traditional Chinese characters for the words "yīn" and "yáng" are both classified as radical-esphonetic characters, combining the semantically significant "mound; hill" radical with the phonetic indicators "ying" and "yang." The first phonetic "yīn" "cloudy" ideographically combines "jīn" "now; present" and "yún" "cloud," denoting the "今 presence of clouds."

In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive principle, while Yang is the active principle, and they are seen in all forms of change and difference, such as the annual cycle, the landscape, sexual coupling, the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history. The material energy, which the universe is made of, is also referred to as qi, and it is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things, including humans.

In conclusion, the concept of yin and yang in Chinese philosophy represents the idea that seemingly opposite forces are actually complementary and interconnected. This concept is depicted in the taijitu symbol and is analyzable in terms of etymology, meanings, topography, and loanwords. It is a fundamental aspect of Chinese cosmology, where it is believed that the organization of qi in the cycles of Yin and Yang has formed the universe and all things within it, including humans.
r1: In Ancient Chinese philosophy, yin and yang is a concept of dualism, describing how obviously opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. The term yang in the phrase means sunny side, bright, or positive. In reference to the surname, Yang, the meaning is willow or aspen.

a: The Garden of Eden, as described in the Book of Genesis, was said to contain four rivers, among them the Pishon, which encircled the entire land of Havilah. While the exact location of the Pishon has never been clearly identified, various scholars have proposed different rivers as its possible identity. According to Flavius Josephus, a Jewish-Roman historian of the 1st century AD, the Pishon was equivalent to the Ganges river. However, other scholars, such as Rashi, a medieval French rabbi, and A.D. Calumet, a 17th-century scholar, have suggested that the Pishon was the Nile river.

One theory is that the Pishon and Gihon, the other river mentioned in the Garden of Eden, were mountain streams, with the Pishon possibly being the Phasis or Araxes river, and the Gihon the Oxus river. This theory is based on the idea that the Garden of Eden was located in a mountainous region, and that the rivers flowed from the surrounding mountains.

The name "Pishon" is derived from the Akkadian word "pishon," meaning "flood" or "torrent," and may be related to the Hebrew word "pesach," meaning "passage" or "crossing." This etymology suggests that the Pishon may have been a river that was known for its fast-flowing waters and potential for flooding.

Overall, while the exact location and identity of the Pishon river remain a subject of debate, it is clear that the Garden of Eden was a place of great beauty and abundance, with four rivers flowing through it and providing sustenance and life to its inhabitants. The Pishon, along with the other rivers of the Garden, was likely an important feature of this sacred space, providing water and nourishment to the plants and animals that lived there.
r1: The Garden of Eden or Garden of God, also called the Terrestrial Paradise, is the biblical paradise described in Genesis 2-3 and Ezekiel 28 and 31. Genesis 2:10-14 lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: Pishon, Gihon, Chidekel (the Tigris), and Phirath (the Euphrates).

Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me... no more," has become iconic and has been featured in various forms of media, including the "Saturday Night Live" sketch "Roxbury Guys" and the video game "Saints Row IV".

The song was written and produced by German music producers Dee Dee Halligan (Dieter Lünstedt a.k.a. Tony Hendrik) and Junior Torello (Karin Hartmann-Eisenblätter a.k.a. Karin van Haaren) of Coconut Records in Cologne. They were searching for the right singer for the song and eventually chose Haddaway, who was a producer, dancer, and choreographer before being signed to Coconut Records.

The song was released in Europe in May 1993 and in the US in August 1993. It was a moderate success outside of Europe, reaching number 11 in the US, number 12 in Australia, number 17 in Canada, and number 48 in New Zealand. However, its enduring popularity has made it a staple of dance clubs and a cultural touchstone to this day. In 2009, German DJ Klaas remixed the song under the title "Klaas meets Haddaway – What Is Love 2K9", which charted in several European countries. In 2016, Belgian DJ Lost Frequencies released a cover of the song, titled "What Is Love 2016", which was produced back in 2014 as a remix for Jaymes Young's cover version of "What Is Love".

Overall, "What Is Love" is a classic dance hit that has stood the test of time and continues to be a beloved anthem for dance floors and pop culture enthusiasts around the world.

a: Sure! Here is a comprehensive, well-structured, and focused paragraph that answers the question "Who holds the record for most passing yards in a season?" and integrates the factoid context provided:

The record for most passing yards in a season is held by Drew Brees, who threw for an astonishing 5,477 yards in 2011. This impressive feat not only earned him the Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award but also broke the previous record of 5,084 yards set by Dan Marino in 1984. Marino's record had stood for 27 years before Brees's record-breaking season. Interestingly, Brees's achievement came just a year after Peyton Manning set league single-season records for passing yards (5,477) and passing touchdowns (55) in 2013. These remarkable performances by Brees and Manning showcase the high level of skill and competition among quarterbacks in the NFL, and they continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in the sport.
r1: Passing for 5,000 yards in a single regular season is a rare achievement in the National Football League (NFL). Eight different quarterbacks have accomplished the feat, Dan Marino was the first when he set an NFL record with 5,084 yards passing in 1984. Peyton Manning currently holds the record with 5,477 passing yards in 2013, with Drew Brees being exactly one yard short of this mark. Drew Brees is the only NFL quarterback to reach 5,000 yards more than once, having done so five times.
r2: Several people have held the record for most passing yards in a season. Peyton Manning currently holds the NFL record with 5,477 in 2013. Drew Brees holds the NFL record for reaching 5,000 passing yards more than once and held the record for most passing yards in a season in 2011. Dan Marino held the record for most in a season in 1984, when he became the first quarterback to pass 5,000 yards in a single regular season, with 5,084.

a: Italy entered the First World War on May 23, 1915, after a long period of political and social unification. The country had been divided into various states since the fall of the Roman Empire, and the process of unification began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna. However, some territories, known as "terre irredente," did not join the Kingdom of Italy until after World War I. The movement for unification was marked by the romantic, nationalist, and patriotic ideals of an Italian renaissance, which sought to conquer a unified political identity and restore the ancient Roman roots of the country.

The political and social changes proposed by Sidney Sonnino, a prominent figure in the unification movement, provoked opposition from the ruling groups, and he was eventually succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti. Despite initially supporting the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Sonnino later sided with the Entente powers and sanctioned the secret Treaty of London in April 1915, which aimed to fulfill Italy's irredentist claims. This led to Italy's declaration of war against Austria-Hungary on May 23, 1915.

The unification of Italy was a complex and prolonged process that spanned several centuries, and it was marked by significant political and social changes. The movement was driven by the desire to create a unified Italian state and to restore the country's ancient Roman roots. However, the process was not without its challenges, and it was marked by opposition from the ruling groups and the struggle for power among different political factions. Ultimately, Italy's entry into World War I was a significant turning point in the country's history, and it marked the completion of the unification process that had begun over a century earlier.
r1: Italy entered into the First World War with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the First World War is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence. It began when the Treaty of London was signed on 26 April 1915 and Italy declared war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915.
r2: Italy entered the First World War in 1915 by signing the Treaty of London on 26 April 1915 and by declaring war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915.

a: The Sahara Desert, which covers much of North Africa, is a vast and diverse ecosystem that is characterized by two main types of climates: desert and steppe. The North Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion, located along the northern edge of the Sahara, forms an ecotone between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara Desert to the south. This ecoregion experiences hot and dry summers, but cooler winters with some rainfall, and is characterized by a variety of habitats, including sandy systems, rocky plateaus, wadis, depressions, and mountains. The Sahara Desert itself is the largest hot desert in the world, covering an area comparable to the size of China or the United States, and is divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert. The Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland over the past several hundred thousand years due to changes in the Earth's axis as it rotates around the sun, which affect the location of the North African Monsoon. This diverse ecosystem is home to a wide range of plants and animals, with many species being endemic to the area.
r1: The Sahara is a desert on the African continent, with an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi). It is the largest hot desert in the world and the third largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic. The North Saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert, next to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the northern Maghreb and Cyrenaica. To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa.

a: The Makkah Royal Clock Tower, located within the Abraj Al Bait complex in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, was built in 2012. The tower stands at a height of 601 meters (1,972 feet), making it the third-tallest building and fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The tower's construction was part of the King Abdulaziz Endowment Project, which aimed to modernize the city and provide better accommodations for pilgrims visiting the holy city. The tower's design incorporates four clock faces, two of which are the largest in the world, with a diameter of 46 meters (151 feet) each. The Abraj Al Bait complex is located just meters away from the Grand Mosque of Mecca, Islam's holiest site, and was built after the demolition of the historic Ajyad Fortress in 2002. The controversial demolition sparked international outcry, particularly from Turkey, which had previously owned the site. The tower's construction was undertaken by the Saudi Binladin Group, the kingdom's largest construction company, at a cost of US$15 billion, making it the world's most expensive building. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower is not only an impressive architectural feat but also a testament to the kingdom's commitment to modernization and religious tourism.

In contrast, the Blue Water Hotel in Wadduwa, Sri Lanka, is a 5-star boutique hotel that was built in 1998. The hotel was designed by renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa and was one of his last projects before his death. The hotel is situated on a former coconut plantation and features a minimalist design that blends seamlessly into its coastal surroundings. The hotel suffered damage during the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami but was renovated and reopened in 2008. The hotel's design is notable for its careful orchestration of spaces between the land and the ocean, creating a serene and peaceful ambiance for guests.

While the two buildings are vastly different in terms of their purpose, location, and design, they both showcase the attention to detail and commitment to excellence that is characteristic of luxury architecture. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower stands as a testament to Saudi Arabia's commitment to modernization and religious tourism, while the Blue Water Hotel represents a masterful blend of minimalist design and natural beauty.

a: India's rank in the World Bank's ease of doing business index is an important indicator of the country's progress in creating a business-friendly environment. According to the World Bank's report, India's rank has improved significantly over the years, from 130th in 2016 to 100th in 2017. This improvement is a result of the government's efforts to reform the business environment, including the introduction of the Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP) in 2015. The BRAP is an annual plan that outlines specific action items to be completed by states and union territories to improve the ease of doing business.

The BRAP covers eight key areas, including starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. Each of these areas has a number of action points that must be completed by the states and union territories. The World Bank ranks the states and union territories based on their completion of these action points, and the rankings are published annually.

The ease of doing business ranking of states of India is not based on the level of business-conducive nature of the states, but rather on the willingness of the states to reform and attract investments. The ranking is an important tool for investors to assess the business environment of different states and make informed decisions about investing in India.

The improvement in India's ease of doing business rank is a result of the government's efforts to simplify regulations, reduce bureaucracy, and increase transparency. For example, the government has introduced the "Make in India" initiative, which aims to attract foreign investment and promote domestic manufacturing. Additionally, the government has introduced the "Digital India" initiative, which aims to promote digital governance and reduce paperwork.

The World Bank's ease of doing business ranking is not only an important indicator of India's progress, but also a benchmark for other countries to follow. The ranking has been cited as an important factor in attracting foreign investment, and has helped to promote competition among states to improve their business environments.

In conclusion, India's rank in the World Bank's ease of doing business index is an important indicator of the country's progress in creating a business-friendly environment. The improvement in the rank is a result of the government's efforts to reform the business environment, and the ranking is an important tool for investors to assess the business environment of different states. The government's efforts to simplify regulations, reduce bureaucracy, and increase transparency have contributed to the improvement in the rank, and the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking is an important benchmark for other countries to follow.
r1: The ease of doing business index is an index created jointly by Simeon Djankov, Michael Klein and Caralee McLiesh, three leading economists at the World Bank Group. Higher rankings (a low numerical value) indicate better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights. In 2015, India was ranked 142 on the scale. From 2016 to 2017, they move up ranks to 130.

a: The Latin word "camera obscura" refers to the natural optical phenomenon where an image of a scene on the other side of a screen is projected as a reversed and inverted image on a surface opposite the opening. The term "camera obscura" also refers to devices that utilize this principle, such as boxes or tents with a small hole or lens that project the image. The camera obscura was used as a drawing aid and to study eclipses without damaging the eyes. The device was first referred to as "camera obscura" in 1604, but other terms such as "cubiculum obscurum" and "pinhole camera" have also been used. The image formed by the camera obscura is created by rays of light that travel through the small opening in the screen and are collected on a surface opposite the opening. The image is reversed and inverted due to the nature of the optics involved. This phenomenon has been used to create highly accurate representations of scenes, especially in the field of drawing and painting.
r1: A camera obscura, from the Latin word camera obscūra or "dark chamber", is a darkened room with a small hole or lens at one side through which an image is projected onto a wall or table opposite the hole. A camera obscura without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a pinhole camera or pinhole image, although this more often refers to simple (homemade) lensless cameras where photographic film or photographic paper is used.
r2: The literal meaning of the Latin word camera obscura is "dark chamber," while its meaning in common photography is "pinhole image." Camera obscura is also the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura.

The team had a strong roster that year, led by stars like Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, and Mike Richter. They defeated the Vancouver Canucks in the Stanley Cup Finals, winning the series 4-3.

The Rangers have a rich history in the NHL, dating back to their founding in 1926 as one of the Original Six teams. They have had their fair share of ups and downs over the years, including a number of Stanley Cup championships and finals appearances. However, the team has not been as successful in recent years, failing to make the playoffs in several seasons and undergoing significant changes to their roster and coaching staff.

One of the most notable moments in Rangers history came in the 1975 playoffs, when they faced off against their arch-rivals, the New York Islanders. The Islanders were a new team that had joined the NHL just nine years prior, but they had already established themselves as a force to be reckoned with. The Rangers and Islanders had a heated rivalry, and their playoff series that year was no exception. The Rangers ultimately lost the series, but it marked the beginning of a long and intense rivalry between the two teams.

In the 1990s, the Rangers made several key trades and signings that helped them return to prominence. They acquired players like Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, and Mike Richter, and hired coach Mike Keenan to lead the team. This led to a number of successful seasons, including the 1993-1994 Stanley Cup championship. However, the team has not been able to replicate that success in the years since, despite making the playoffs on several occasions.

This type of fat is located between the organs in the abdominal cavity, such as the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys, and is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots. Visceral fat is distinct from subcutaneous fat, which is found beneath the skin, and intramuscular fat, which is interspersed within skeletal muscles.

Visceral fat is particularly important because it is associated with a number of health risks, including central obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related diseases. In fact, excess visceral fat is often referred to as "belly fat" and is linked to a higher risk of mortality. To measure the amount of visceral fat in the body, new developments such as the Body Volume Index (BVI) have been created to measure abdominal volume and abdominal fat.

In addition to visceral fat, adipose tissue can also be found in other areas of the body, such as the thighs, buttocks, and neck. However, the adipose tissue found in these areas is typically subcutaneous fat, which is not as closely linked to health risks as visceral fat. Adipose tissue is composed of adipocytes, which are specialized cells that store energy in the form of lipids, as well as other cells such as preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and immune cells. Adipose tissue also produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα, highlighting its importance as a major endocrine organ in the body.
r1: Adipose tissue, body fat, or simply fat is a loose connective tissue composed mostly of adipocytes, and is found beneath the skin, around internal organs, in bone marrow, intermuscular, and in the breast. In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and a variety of immune cells such as adipose tissue macrophages. Adipose depots are areas in the body where adipose tissue can be found.

a: Sure, here's a comprehensive answer to the question "How much did it cost Rio to host the Olympics?" based on the provided factoid context:

Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics at a cost of US$14.4 billion, after three failed attempts to host the Games in 1936, 2004, and 2012. This was the city's first successful bid, which was concluded with the election of Rio de Janeiro as the host city during the 121st IOC Session held in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009. The cost of hosting the Games included the construction of 30 competition venues in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—as well as venues for golf and rugby union, which were added to the Olympic program after the election. Additionally, football matches were held in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador, and São Paulo. The proposed dates for the Olympic Games were from August 5 to 21, while the Paralympic Games were held from September 7 to 18.

Rio de Janeiro's bidding process began on July 28, 2006, when the Executive Council of the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) met to consider the possibility of nominating a Brazilian city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The city's initial budget for the Games was estimated at US$10.4 billion, but it eventually rose to US$14.4 billion due to various factors such as inflation, currency fluctuations, and the need for additional infrastructure projects. Despite the high cost, Rio de Janeiro's successful bid to host the Games marked a significant milestone for South America and the city, bringing international recognition and economic benefits to the region.
r1: The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost international sporting event with over 200 nations participating, has historically had the highest costs and expenses for the hosts, with the final operating budget of the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro being at approximately US$13,100,000,000, and a taxpayer contribution of US$11.6 billion.

a: The history of unemployment benefits in the UK can be traced back to the Poor Relief Act of 1601, which established a system of poor relief distribution in England and Wales. This system was not a centralized government policy but rather a collection of laws passed between the 16th and 18th centuries that made individual parishes responsible for poor relief legislation. The Act saw a move away from punishing paupers towards methods of "correction." (1)

Fast forward to the 20th century, and the first unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in the UK with the National Insurance Act of 1911, under the Liberal Party government of H. H. Asquith. This Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment, but only applied to wage earners, their families, and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support. (2)

In the present day, Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is an unemployment benefit paid by the Government of the United Kingdom to people who are unemployed and actively seeking work. It is part of the social security benefits system and is intended to cover living expenses while the claimant is out of work. To be eligible for JSA, claimants must state that they are actively seeking work by filling in a "Jobseeker's Agreement" form and attending a New Jobseeker interview (NJI). They must also go to a Job Centre every two weeks to "sign on," that is, to certify that they are still actively seeking work. (3)

Unemployment benefits in the UK have evolved over time to provide financial support to those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The current system, which includes JSA and other forms of support, is designed to help individuals while they are looking for work and to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially.

a: The Major League Baseball record for most hits in a row is held by Joe DiMaggio, who had a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941. During this streak, DiMaggio hit .408 with 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in. This record has stood the test of time, and there have been only 55 instances in MLB history where a player has had a hitting streak of at least 30 games. Additionally, there have been several instances of multiple players achieving streaks of at least 30 games in the same season, such as in 1922, 1987, 1997, 1999, 2006, and 2011.

Joe DiMaggio's streak is all the more impressive when considering the context of the time period in which he played. The 1941 season was marked by the United States' entry into World War II, and many players were away serving in the military. Additionally, the Yankees played 24 games in 24 days during DiMaggio's streak, which put a strain on his body and made it even more impressive that he was able to maintain his hitting streak.

DiMaggio's hitting streak was not just a product of his individual talent, but also of the era in which he played. The 1940s were a time of high scoring in baseball, with the average runs per game increasing from 4.3 in the 1930s to 5.1 in the 1940s. Additionally, the Yankees were a powerful team with a strong lineup, which provided DiMaggio with plenty of opportunities to hit.

Despite the impressive nature of DiMaggio's streak, it is worth noting that there have been other notable hitting streaks in MLB history. For example, Johnny Kling, a catcher for the Chicago Cubs in the early 20th century, had a streak of 12 consecutive hits in August 1902, which was a record at the time. Additionally, there have been several players who have had streaks of at least 30 games, including Paul Molitor, Benito Santiago, Nomar Garciaparra, and Luis Gonzalez.

Overall, the record for most hits in a row in Major League Baseball is held by Joe DiMaggio, who had a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941. This streak is all the more impressive when considering the context of the time period in which he played, and it stands as one of the most iconic moments in baseball history.
r1: In baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in which a player appears and gets at least one base hit. The MLB record for most games with a hit in a row is 56, and is by Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees. The MLB record for most plate appearances with hits in a row is 12, and is tied by Johnny Kling of the Chicago Cubs, and Walt Dropo of the Detroit Tigers.
r2: In baseball, a hitting streak is the number of consecutive official games in which a player appears and gets at least one base hit.

a: The group of cells that control the natural resting heart rate are located in the sinoatrial node (SA node), which is situated in the right atrium of the heart. The SA node is a banana-shaped structure that produces electrical impulses spontaneously, setting the heart's rhythm and acting as the heart's natural pacemaker. The rate of action potential production and therefore the heart rate is influenced by nerves that supply the SA node. If the SA node fails to function or the impulse is blocked, the atrioventricular node (AV node) or Purkinje fibers can act as the default or "escape" pacemaker. The SA node is responsible for producing action potentials at a constant rate, which are then transmitted through the electrical conduction system of the heart, causing it to contract. The action potentials are generated due to the movement of charged atoms (ions) across the cell membrane, and the SA node does not have a resting phase, instead, it produces a pacemaker potential that reaches a set value, known as the threshold value, to initiate an action potential. The SA node is a critical component of the heart's electrical conduction system and plays a vital role in regulating the heart's rhythm and rate.
r1: The main role of a sinoatrial node cell, or SA node, is to initiate action potentials of the heart, so that it can pass throughout the heart and cause contraction. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum.
r2: The sinoatrial node (also known as the SA node or the sinus node) is a group of cells located in the wall of the right atrium of the heart. In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potential, setting the rhythm of the heart and so is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The normal resting heart rate is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum.

a: The dna-directed synthesis of an rna molecule is called transcription. This process is facilitated by an enzyme called RNA polymerase (RNAP), which reads the dna template and adds nucleotides to a growing rna chain. Transcription is the first step of gene expression and is essential for the synthesis of proteins, as well as the production of other types of rna molecules such as microRNA and ribosomal RNA. RNAP is a highly specific enzyme that can only bind to specific dna sequences called promoters, and it requires the presence of a transcription factor to initiate transcription. Once the transcription is initiated, RNAP unwinds the dna double helix and moves along the template strand, adding nucleotides to the growing rna chain. The resulting rna molecule is called a primary transcript, and it may undergo further processing before being transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for translation. In eukaryotic cells, RNAP can synthesize rna chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides. Overall, transcription is a crucial step in the central dogma of molecular biology, as it allows cells to convert genetic information encoded in dna into functional rna molecules that can be used for protein synthesis and other cellular processes.
r1: Transcription is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA. The segments of DNA transcribed into RNA molecules that can encode proteins are said to produce messenger RNA (mRNA). Other segments of DNA are copied into RNA molecules called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).

a: Texas became part of the United States on December 29, 1845, when it was admitted as the 28th state. The Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836, and the vast majority of the Texian population favored annexation by the United States. However, the leadership of both major political parties, the Democrats and the Whigs, opposed annexation due to the political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Additionally, Mexico refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province, and the U.S. President at the time, John Tyler, pursued annexation as a bid to gain popular support for his presidency and to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government to emancipate slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the U.S.

The annexation of Texas was a complex and contentious process that involved negotiations with Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. government. William H. Bourland, a prominent figure in Texas politics during this period, introduced legislation that incorporated Paris, the county seat of Lamar County, and later served as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. Texas County, Oklahoma, was formed in 1907 from the central one-third of "Old Beaver County" and was named after the state that adjoins it to the south. The county's economy is largely based on farming and cattle production, and it is one of the top producing counties in the U.S. for wheat, cattle, and hogs.

In conclusion, Texas became part of the United States in 1845 after a complex and contentious annexation process that involved negotiations with Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. government. The annexation was driven by a variety of factors, including political and economic interests, as well as the desire to outmaneuver diplomatic efforts by the British government to emancipate slaves in Texas. Today, Texas is a thriving state with a strong economy and a rich history, and its annexation remains a significant event in the history of the United States.

a: The Chicago Cubs have played in the World Series a total of eleven times, with their most recent appearance being in 2016. The team's history in the Fall Classic dates back to 1906, when they won the championship, but then went on to lose in four consecutive World Series from 1910 to 1914. The Cubs then made it back to the World Series in 1918, 1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, but failed to win the championship each time. The team's longest drought without a World Series appearance was a record 71 years, which was finally broken in 2016 when the Cubs won the National League Championship Series and went on to win the World Series. This drought was the longest in Major League Baseball history, and it was finally ended when the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the World Series.

The Cubs' history in the World Series is marked by a mix of success and heartbreak. In 1906, the team won the championship with a then-modern-era record winning percentage of .763, but then lost the World Series to the Chicago White Sox in 1906 and 1917. The Cubs then made it back to the World Series in 1929, 1932, and 1935, but were defeated each time by the New York Yankees. The team's most recent World Series appearance before their 2016 victory was in 1945, when they were defeated by the Detroit Tigers.

The Cubs' rivalry with the White Sox is also notable, as the two teams have a long history of competition and have often been the only two Major League Baseball teams in Chicago. The teams have played each other in the World Series twice, in 1906 and 1917, with the Cubs winning both times. The rivalry is unique in that the teams have had relatively little success for a long time, with the White Sox winning the World Series only once, in 2005, and the Cubs not winning a championship since 1908. However, the teams have recently experienced more success, with the Cubs winning the World Series in 2016 and the White Sox making it to the playoffs in 2005 and 2008.

In 2018, the Cubs had a successful season, clinching a trip to the postseason for the fourth year in a row and finishing the season with a record of 95–67. However, they ultimately failed to win the division for a third consecutive year, losing to the Milwaukee Brewers in a 163rd game to determine the Central Division champions. Despite this, the team made it to the Wild Card Game against the Colorado Rockies, but lost in 13 innings. The Cubs have continued to make improvements to their stadium, Wrigley Field, as part of the "1060 Project," which aims to modernize the facility while preserving its historic charm.
r1: The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as part of the National League (NL) Central division.

a: Walmart's success in offering great value products can be attributed to its extensive use of private label brands. The company has been offering private label brands since 1991, with the launch of Sam's Choice, a line of drinks produced by Cott Beverages for Walmart. This move proved to be highly successful, with Sam's Choice quickly becoming the third-most popular beverage brand in the United States by 1993. Today, Walmart offers private label brands not only in the US but also in Canada and Britain, under the names Great Value and Equate, and Smart Price respectively. The company's use of private label brands allows it to offer products at lower prices to its customers, while still maintaining a high level of quality. In fact, a 2006 study found that Walmart holds a significant amount of "mind-share" among shoppers when it comes to private label brands and retailers. Additionally, the company has partnered with Procter & Gamble to produce original movies and TV shows that feature Walmart and Procter & Gamble-branded products, further increasing its brand recognition and value among consumers. Overall, Walmart's focus on private label brands has been a key factor in its ability to offer great value products to its customers.
r1: Great Value was launched in 1993 and forms the second tier, or national brand equivalent, of Walmart's grocery branding strategy. Products offered through the Great Value brand are often claimed to be as good as national brand offerings, but are typically sold at a lower price because of lower marketing and advertising expense. Walmart contends that all Great Value products are produced in the United States. There are a number of agricultural and food corporations, such as ConAgra, and Sara Lee, that Walmart gets its Great Value supply from.
r2: Walmart, Inc., like many large retail and grocery chain stores, offers private brands (also called house brands or store brands), which are lower-priced alternatives to name brand products.

a: The confluence of River Niger and River Benue is located at Lokoja, the capital of Kogi State in central Nigeria. Kogi State is known as the Confluence State due to the meeting point of these two major rivers. The Niger River flows through several countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Mali, Niger, Benin, and Nigeria, before emptying into the Gulf of Guinea. The Benue River, which is the main tributary of the Niger River, flows through Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad before joining the Niger River at Lokoja. The Niger River is the third-longest river in Africa, after the Nile and the Congo River, and is an important source of water, transportation, and commerce for the regions it flows through.

The Niger River is also known for its seasonal flooding, which begins in September and peaks in November, providing fertile soil for agriculture and fishing. However, the river loses a significant amount of water due to seepage and evaporation, particularly in the Inner Niger Delta region, which is characterized by braided streams, marshes, and lakes. The average loss of water in the Niger River is estimated to be around 31 kilometers per year, with some years experiencing higher or lower losses.

In Nigeria, the Niger River is an important source of water for irrigation, agriculture, and drinking water, as well as a transportation route for people and goods. The state of Kogi is located at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers, and its economy is largely based on agriculture, with the main crops being rice, cassava, and yams. The state is also rich in mineral resources, including coal, petroleum, and steel. The diverse ethnic groups in Kogi State, including the Igala, Ebira, and Okun, have their own unique languages and cultures, adding to the rich cultural heritage of the state.

Overall, the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers at Lokoja, Kogi State, is a significant geographical feature that supports the economy, culture, and way of life of the people in the region. The Niger River, with its seasonal flooding and rich mineral resources, plays a vital role in the development and prosperity of Kogi State and the surrounding regions.
r1: The Niger River is the principal river of West Africa, extending about 4,180 km (2,600 mi). The Benue River, previously known as the Chadda River or Tchadda, is the major tributary of the Niger River. The two major rivers meet in the city of Lokoja in the Kogi state, in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, making it the confluence state.
r2: The main rivers in Nigeria are the Niger and the Benue, which converge and empty into the Niger Delta. The River Niger and River Benue also meet in Kogi State, one of the 36 States of Nigeria, located in the Nigerian Northern Nigeria. Kogi State is nicknamed the "Confluence State" due the fact that the confluence of the River Niger and the River Benue occurs in its capital, Lokoja.

a: The speech "Ain't I a Woman?" was delivered by Sojourner Truth in 1851 at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. The speech was not given a title at the time of its delivery, but was later titled "Ain't I a Woman?" after its oft-repeated refrain. The speech was first reported in two contemporary newspapers and later published in the "Anti-Slavery Bugle" on June 21, 1851. The speech gained wider publicity during the American Civil War when it was published again in 1863 by Frances Dana Barker Gage, who made several additions to Truth's original speech. Gage's version of the speech, which is the one most widely known today, was published in 1875, 1881, and 1889.

The speech "Ain't I a Woman?" is significant not only for its powerful message, but also for its historical context. Truth's speech was delivered during a time when women, particularly black women, were fighting for their rights and facing discrimination and oppression. The speech challenged the gender and racial stereotypes of the time, as Truth spoke out against the injustices faced by black women and highlighted their strength and resilience.

The phrase "Am I not a man and a brother?" had been used by British abolitionists since the late 18th century to decry the inhumanity of slavery. However, Truth's speech turned this male motto into a female one, declaring "Am I not a woman and a sister?" This shift in language was significant, as it challenged the notion that women, particularly black women, were inferior to men and highlighted their shared humanity and suffering.

Truth's speech also highlighted the unique experiences of black women during slavery, as they were subjected to both gender and racial discrimination. Truth spoke out against the stereotypes that black women were promiscuous and immoral, and instead emphasized their strength and resilience in the face of oppression.

In 1981, bell hooks wrote the book "Ain't I a Woman?," which examines the effect of racism and sexism on black women and the civil rights and feminist movements. Hooks argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. She also highlights the stereotypes that were set during slavery and how they still affect black women today.

Overall, "Ain't I a Woman?" is a powerful speech that challenged the gender and racial stereotypes of the time and highlighted the experiences and struggles of black women. The speech has become a symbol of the fight for women's rights and racial equality, and its message continues to resonate today.
r1: "Ain't I a Woman?" is a speech, delivered extemporaneously, by Sojourner Truth, (1797–1883), born into slavery in New York State. She later became a well known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, on May 29, 1851, and did not originally have a title. Almost a month later, the speech was briefly reported in two contemporary newspapers, and a transcript of the speech was published in the "Anti-Slavery Bugle" on June 21, 1851. Twelve years later, in May 1863, Frances Dana Barker Gage published a very different transcription. In it, she gave Truth many of the speech characteristics of Southern slaves, and she included new material that Robinson had not reported. In 1981, the book "Ain't I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism" was published by Bell Hooks, where she examines the effect of racism and sexism on black women, the civil rights movement, and feminist movements from suffrage to the 1970s.

a: GVWR stands for Gross Vehicle Weight Rating, which is the maximum operating weight of a truck, including the vehicle's chassis, body, engine, engine fluids, fuel, accessories, driver, passengers, and cargo, but excluding any trailers. The term is used for motor vehicles and trains, and it is important to note that the weight of a vehicle can be influenced by various factors such as passengers, cargo, and fuel level. There are different terms used to express the weight of a vehicle in a designated state, including Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR), which refers to the total mass of a vehicle and all trailers, and Gross Trailer Weight Rating (GTW), which specifies the maximum weight of a trailer.

When it comes to truck campers, the GVWR of the truck is an important factor in determining the maximum size camper that can be carried. The GVWR minus the weight of the truck with passengers and fuel is the payload that the truck may legally carry. To improve stability, additional features such as sway bars, overload springs, and inflatable airbags may be added to the rear suspension. It is important to consider the dry weight of the camper, which is the weight of the camper less any fluids, possessions, and add-ons, when determining the maximum size camper that can be carried. Additionally, tires and braking capacity are crucial factors in determining the maximum payload, as they can affect the safety of the vehicle. It is important to note that the total axle capacity is always higher than the GVWR, and tires and braking are frequently the rate-determining factor from a safety perspective.
r1: The gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), or gross vehicle mass (GVM), is the maximum operating weight/mass of a vehicle as specified by the manufacturer including the vehicle's chassis, body, engine, engine fluids, fuel, accessories, driver, passengers and cargo but excluding that of any trailers.

a: The Cleveland Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, following a three-year hiatus due to the team's relocation to Baltimore and subsequent renaming as the Ravens. The Browns were originally founded in 1945 by Arthur B. McBride and Paul Brown, and they quickly became a dominant force in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), winning four championships in the league's four seasons. When the AAFC folded, the Browns joined the NFL and continued their success, winning four more championships in their first ten years. However, the team struggled in the following decades, and in 1996, owner Art Modell announced that he would be moving the team to Baltimore, where they would become the Ravens. The move was met with controversy and protests from fans and the city of Cleveland, and the Browns were forced to suspend operations for three years. In 1999, the team was reactivated and returned to the NFL, but they have struggled to regain their former success, with only two winning seasons since their return. Despite this, the team has a dedicated fan base and a rich history, and many former players and coaches remain involved with the organization.
r1: The Cleveland Browns are a professional American football team based in Cleveland. The team went inactive in 1996 , but re-established themselves in 1998.

a: The blastocyst, after being fertilized and undergoing several cell divisions, implants itself in the female human reproductive system, specifically in the uterine wall. This process of implantation is crucial for the continuation of pregnancy and is facilitated by hormonal changes in the mother, such as a peak in luteinizing hormone (LH), which prepares the endometrium to receive the blastocyst. Once the blastocyst attaches to the extracellular matrix of the endometrium, trophoblast cells secrete enzymes and other factors that allow the blastocyst to invade the endometrium and establish a connection with the maternal blood supply. This process of implantation also triggers the formation of the placenta, which will provide nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryo and remove waste products.

Interestingly, there are cases of abdominal pregnancy, also known as extra-uterine pregnancy, where the blastocyst implants outside of the uterus, usually in the abdominal cavity. This condition was first recognized by Arab Muslim physician Albucasis in the 10th century and was later described in detail by Italian physician Jacopo Berengario da Carpi in the 16th century. Abdominal pregnancy is rare and can be dangerous for both the mother and the developing embryo, as it can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, and premature delivery. However, it can also serve as a model for studying human male pregnancy or for females who lack a uterus.

In conclusion, the blastocyst implanted in the female human reproductive system undergoes a complex process of implantation, which involves the interaction of hormonal changes, cellular differentiation, and the formation of the placenta. Any disruptions in this process can lead to complications such as abdominal pregnancy, which can be dangerous for both the mother and the developing embryo.
r1: The blastocyst is a structure formed in the early development of mammals. It possesses an inner cell mass (ICM) which subsequently forms the embryo. Implantation establishes a connection between the mother and the early embryo which will continue through the remainder of the pregnancy, and is made possible through structural changes in both the blastocyst and endometrial wall. In an ectopic pregnancy, which is when the embryo attaches outside the uterus, it can become implanted in the fallopian tube, cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen.
r2: Implantation is critical to the survival and development of the early human embryo. It establishes a connection between the mother and the early embryo which will continue through the remainder of the pregnancy. Once bound to the extracellular matrix of the endometrium, trophoblast cells secrete enzymes and other factors to embed the blastocyst into the uterine wall. Ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. In an ectopic pregnancy the blastocyst can be implanted in the fallopian tube, cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen.

a: In the 2002 NBA Finals, Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers faced off against the New Jersey Nets, with Bryant averaging 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game. Despite being the youngest player to win three championships at the age of 23, Bryant's performance in the 2002 Finals was notable for his clutch play in the fourth quarter of games, particularly in the last two rounds of the playoffs. This cemented his reputation as a "clutch player" and helped the Lakers defeat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance.

In the 2001 NBA Finals, the Lakers, led by Shaquille O'Neal, won the series 4-1 against the Philadelphia 76ers. Despite being out-shot and out-rebounded in the series, the Lakers punished the 76ers with their three-point shooting, with Robert Horry hitting a crucial three-pointer in the last minute of Game 3 and the team using hot three-point shooting to build big leads and hold off late 76ers comeback attempts in Games 4 and 5.

The Lakers' success in the 2001 and 2002 Finals was largely due to the strong duo of O'Neal and Bryant, backed by a deep bench, and the implementation of the triangle offense by coach Phil Jackson, which had previously led to six championships with the Chicago Bulls. Bryant's performance in the 2002 Finals was particularly impressive, as he averaged over 26 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game and cemented his reputation as a clutch player.
r1: Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player. As a shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Throughout his career, he has defeated multiple teams in the NBA Finals. In the 2000 Finals against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's foot, and didn't return until Game 4, where he scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an OT victory. In the 2001 NBA Finals, the Lakers won the series 4 games to 1 against the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers. In the 2002 NBA Finals, the Lakers swept the Nets, four games to none, to win the franchise's 14th NBA championship and third consecutive NBA championship. Years later in the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers faced the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic, and defeated them four games to one, to win the franchise's 15th NBA championship. The next year, in the 2010 NBA Finals, the Lakers faced the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics, and defeated them four games to three, to win the franchise's 16th NBA championship. In the 2012 Olympic Finals, the United States played Spain in basketball, in a rematch of the 2008 finals, and once again defeated Spain to capture the gold.

a: Sure! Here's the comprehensive paragraph-long answer to the question:

Michael Burnham, played by Sonequa Martin-Green, is the lead character in Star Trek: Discovery. She is a complex and multifaceted character who serves as the first officer of the USS Shenzhou under Captain Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh). However, after a mutiny, Burnham is stripped of her rank and recruited by Gabriel Lorca (Jason Isaacs) as a science specialist on the Discovery. Despite her tumultuous past, Burnham is a brilliant and resourceful individual who proves to be an invaluable asset to the crew. Her background as an anthropologist and her experience with the Klingons make her a unique and important addition to the team.

The character of Michael Burnham is significant not only because she is the first black female lead in a Star Trek television series, but also because she is the first leading character who has never been a Starfleet captain. This departure from the traditional Starfleet hierarchy adds a fresh perspective to the show and allows for new and exciting storylines. Additionally, the reveal that Burnham is the foster sister of Spock adds an interesting layer of continuity to the Star Trek universe, even though it was met with some controversy among fans.

Terry Serpico, the actor who plays Captain Lorca, brings a wealth of experience to the role. With a background in stunt performing and numerous guest appearances on various television shows, Serpico brings a physicality and depth to the character that adds to the show's success. His recurring roles in "Rescue Me" and "Army Wives" also demonstrate his range as an actor and his ability to bring complex characters to life. Overall, the combination of Martin-Green's strong performance as Burnham and Serpico's compelling portrayal of Lorca make for a captivating and dynamic duo at the heart of Star Trek: Discovery.
r1: Katrina Cornwell, portrayed by Jayne Brook, is a Starfleet admiral on American television series Star Trek: Discovery. She appears several times as Captain Lorca's direct superior and later confidant. She and Lorca had a previous romantic relationship.

a: Sure! Here is a comprehensive paragraph that incorporates the factoid context and provides a thorough analysis of the record for three pointers in an NCAA game:

Keith Veney holds the record for the most three-pointers made in an NCAA game with 15, which he achieved on December 14, 1996, while playing for Marshall University. This record is particularly impressive given that it has stood the test of time, with no other player has been able to match or surpass it in the over two decades since Veney set the record. Additionally, Veney's 409 career three-pointers are currently in the top 10 all-time in Division I history, highlighting his prolific shooting ability and consistent success from beyond the arc. The game in which Veney set the record, a 120-81 victory over Morehead State, also set several other records, including the most combined points in an NCAA game and the most three-pointers made in a Georgetown game. While Veney's record has stood the test of time, it is worth noting that the game itself was not without its challenges, as Veney's team, the Hoyas, faced a tough opponent in California just six days later and were unable to repeat their success, ultimately falling in the second round of the NIT. Nonetheless, Veney's record remains an impressive achievement and a testament to his skill and dedication as a collegiate basketball player.
r1: Through December 18, 2019, only 19 players have made at least 12 three-point field goals in a single game. The all-time record is 15, which had only occurred one time between 1986–87 and 2017–18, by Marshall's Keith Veney. On December 14, 1996, he set the record against Morehead State. Then, within a two-night span in November 2018, two other players tied Veney's record. On November 14, Robert Morris' Josh Williams made 15, and then on November 15 Furman's Jordan Lyons matched it. Only three other players have made 14 three-pointers: Ronald Blackshear, Dave Jamerson and Askia Jones.
r2: The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) keeps records of the Division I 3-point field made in a game. The all-time record for 3-pointers in a game is 15. Marshall's Keith Veney, Robert Morris' Josh Williams and Furman's Jordan Lyons all have recorded 15 3-pointers in a game.

a: The Portuguese called the region that is now known as Mumbai by several different names during their colonial period. According to Gaspar Correia's "Lendas da Índia" (1508), the name "Bombaim" was used, which is believed to have originated from the Galician-Portuguese phrase "bom baim," meaning "good little bay." This name was still commonly used in Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries. Other variations of the name recorded during this time include "Tana-Maiambu," "Mombayn," "Bombay," "Bombain," "Bombaym," "Monbaym," "Mombaim," "Mombaym," "Bambaye," "Bombaiim," "Bombeye," "Boon Bay," and "Bon Bahia." After the English gained possession of the city in the 17th century, the Portuguese name was anglicized as "Bombay," which is the name that has endured to the present day.
r1: The oldest known names for the city are "Kakamuchee" and "Galajunkja"; these are sometimes still used. In 1508, Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia used the name "Bombaim" in his "Lendas da Índia" ("Legends of India"). This name possibly originated as the Galician-Portuguese phrase "bom baim", meaning "good little bay", and "Bombaim" is still commonly used in Portuguese. In 1516, Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name "Tana-Maiambu": "Tana" appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and "Maiambu" to "Mumbadevi".
r2: Mumbai, also known as Bombay which was the official name until 1995, is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. In 1508, Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia used the name "Bombaim" in his "Lendas da Índia" or "Legends of India". In 1516, Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name "Tana-Maiambu" where"Tana" appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and "Maiambu" to "Mumbadevi".

a: The 1984 American drama film "Places in the Heart" was filmed in Waxahachie, Texas, a small, segregated town in the midst of the Great Depression. The film tells the story of Edna Spalding, a widow who must raise her children alone and maintain the family farm after her husband, the local sheriff, is accidentally shot and killed by a young black boy. The town's racial tensions are heightened when the boy is later lynched by white vigilantes, and Edna is faced with the challenge of keeping her farm afloat despite the struggling economy and the bank's pressure to sell. The film features an all-star cast, including Sally Field, Lindsay Crouse, Ed Harris, and John Malkovich, and was directed by Robert Benton. The movie was shot on location in Waxahachie, which provided a unique and authentic backdrop for the story. The town's historic downtown area, with its old cotton mills and railroad depot, were used as the setting for many of the film's key scenes. The film's portrayal of racial tensions and the struggles of rural life during the Depression era is a powerful reminder of the challenges faced by many Americans during this time period. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Sally Field won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

a: Scooter Gennett holds the record for the most RBIs in a single game in Major League Baseball history, with 10 RBIs on June 6, 2017, against the St. Louis Cardinals. This achievement is all the more impressive considering that Gennett hit four home runs in the game, including a grand slam, and set a club record with 17 total bases. In addition to his impressive offensive performance, Gennett is also known for his unique nickname, which he earned as a child after a run-in with the police.

According to the rules of baseball, errors can affect the number of RBIs a player earns in a game. For example, if a batter hits a ball that should have been a sacrifice fly but the outfielder drops the ball, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in. However, if a play should have resulted in a fielder's choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely, but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder's choice with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.

One curious loophole in the rules on errors exists for catchers. If a catcher makes a "wild throw" in an attempt to prevent a stolen base and the runner is safe, the catcher is not charged with an error, even if it could be argued that the runner would have been put out with "ordinary effort." This "no fault" condition for the catcher attempting to prevent a steal is a unique aspect of the rules that can affect the number of RBIs a player earns in a game.

In comparison to other great power hitters in baseball history, such as Hack Wilson, who hit 56 home runs in 1930, Gennett's 10 RBIs in a single game are truly exceptional. Wilson's accomplishments, like Gennett's, were marked by both impressive offensive performance and a unique personality. However, while Wilson's achievements were widely recognized during his playing career, it was not until after his death that he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.

Overall, Scooter Gennett's record-tying performance on June 6, 2017, is a testament to his exceptional offensive skills and his ability to come through in clutch situations. While errors can affect the number of RBIs a player earns in a game, the unique loophole for catchers and the context of Gennett's achievement make his 10 RBIs all the more impressive.
r1: In baseball, a run batted in (RBI) is awarded to a batter for each runner who scores as a result of the batter's action. In a single season, the most RBIs is awarded to Hack Wilson with 191 in 1930. However, Hank Aaron has the most career RBIs in Major League history with a total of 2,297. In a single game, the most RBIs is awarded to Jim Bottomley and Mark Whiten, when Whiten hit four home runs to complement his 12 RBIs for the St. Louis Cardinals on September 7, 1993. The team that holds the most RBIs in a single season would be the Boston Beaneaters, now known as
r2: A run batted in is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored. For example, if the batter bats a base hit which allows a teammate on a higher base to reach home and so score a run, then the batter gets credited with an RBI. Hank Aaron has the most career RBIs with 2,297. Hank Wilson has the most RBIs in a single season with 191. Jim Bottomley and Mark Whiten are tied for the players with the most RBIs in a single game with 12. The team with the most RBIs in a single season was the Boston Beaneaters, now known as the Atlanta Braves.

a: The California wildfires of 2017 started in October and December of that year, with a total of 9,133 fires burning over 1.2 million acres of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fires destroyed or damaged over 10,000 structures, killing 47 people, including 45 civilians and 2 firefighters. The 2017 wildfire season was the most destructive on record in California at the time, with a total property damage of $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion in insured losses and $300 million in fire suppression costs.

The fires started in October, during severe fire weather conditions, with multiple wildfires breaking out throughout Napa, Lake, Sonoma, Mendocino, and Butte counties. The fires rapidly grew to become massive conflagrations, spanning from 1,000 to well over 20,000 acres within a single day, and destroyed an estimated 8,900+ structures. The fires also forced over 20,000 people to evacuate and burned over 2.2 million acres of land.

In December, a series of wildfires ignited across Southern California, with six of the fires becoming significant wildfires and leading to widespread evacuations and property losses. The largest of the wildfires was the Thomas Fire, which grew to over 281,000 acres, becoming the largest wildfire in modern California history, until it was surpassed by the Ranch Fire in the Mendocino Complex in the following year. The December wildfires burned over 230,000 acres, caused traffic disruptions, school closures, hazardous air conditions, and power outages, and forced over 230,000 people to evacuate.

The 2017 California wildfires were exacerbated by unusually powerful and long-lasting Santa Ana winds, as well as large amounts of dry vegetation, due to a then-far unusually dry rainy season. The fires occurred at the end of an unusually active and destructive wildfire season, with the total property damage surpassed by the 2018 California wildfires. The maps depict the location and burn areas of some of the major wildfires, including the Thomas Fire, which became the largest wildfire in modern California history.

a: France was occupied by Germany in World War II on May 10, 1940, following the German military invasion of the country. The occupation lasted until December 1944, with the German military administration in France formally existing from May 1940 to December 1944. However, most of France had been liberated by the Allies by the end of summer 1944. The German military administration in France was established after the Second Armistice at Compiègne, which was signed on June 22, 1940, and divided France into an occupied northern zone and an unoccupied southern zone. The Vichy government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, remained in existence but with limited authority, and the military administration in the occupied zone was a Nazi dictatorship. The Italian occupation zone was also occupied by Germany and added to the "zone sud" after Italy's surrender in September 1943, except for Corsica, which was liberated by the landings of Free French forces and local Italian troops that had switched sides to the Allies. The German military administration in France was responsible for civilian affairs in the wide "zone interdite" along the Atlantic coast and the "forbidden zone" in north-eastern France, and it was intended for German settlers and annexation in the coming Nazi New Order ("Neue Ordnung"). War refugees were prohibited from returning to their homes, and the German military administration also re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine, which had been annexed by the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.
r1: The Military Administration in France was an interim occupation authority established by Nazi Germany during World War II to administer the occupied zone in areas of northern and western France. It started on 22 June 1940 with the signing of The Armistice of 22 June 1940, following defeats in May and early June, and spanned from 1940–1944. However, this agreement didn't come into effect until after midnight on 25 June. By summer 1944, most of France's territory had been liberated by the Allies.
r2: In World War II, France was occupied by Germany over a period of several years, with the dates of the official start and end of the occupation differing from the unofficial occupation dates. Germany occupied France over the years 1940–1944, with the start of the occupation being on 22 June 1940, though the occupation officially began through armistice after midnight on 25 June 1940. Most of France was liberated and no longer occupied by Germany in summer 1944, but France was only officially no longer occupied in December 1944.

a: The song "If I Ruled the World" has a rich history, with multiple versions and interpretations spanning across different genres and generations. The original version was composed by Leslie Bricusse and Cyril Ornadel for the 1963 West End musical "Pickwick," based on Charles Dickens's "The Pickwick Papers." The song was later popularized by Sir Harry Secombe, who reached No. 18 on the UK charts with his rendition. The song has since been covered by various artists, including Tony Bennett, Stevie Wonder, and Celine Dion.

In the hip-hop world, the song was famously sampled by Nas in his 1996 hit "If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)," featuring Lauryn Hill. Produced by Trackmasters and featuring an uncredited input from Rashad Smith, the song was Nas's first Top 20 R&B hit and was nominated for a 1997 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. Lauryn Hill's verse interpolates the song "Walk Right Up To The Sun" by The Delfonics. The lyrics feature Nas discussing the various things he would do if he "ruled the world and everything in it."

The song is considered one of the greatest rap songs of all time, with many publications ranking it as such. It was also ranked 88 on XXL's Best Songs of the 90's. The high-budget music video directed by Hype Williams helped bring the single mainstream attention, reaching No. 53 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, No. 17 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart, and No. 15 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.

Lauryn Hill, the featured artist on the song, is an American singer, rapper, and songwriter known for her work with Fugees and her solo album "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill." Raised in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood and rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and her rendition of the hit "Killing Me Softly." Her tumultuous romantic relationship with Wyclef Jean led to the split of the band Fugees in 1997, after which she began to focus on solo projects. "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" remains her only solo studio album, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary voice within the neo soul genre.

In conclusion, "If I Ruled the World" is a timeless song with multiple interpretations and versions, spanning across different genres and generations. From its origins in the 1963 West End musical "Pickwick" to its hip-hop reinterpretation by Nas and Lauryn Hill, the song has left a lasting impact on music history.

a: Plywood has been used in furniture production for over a century, with its introduction in the early 1900s revolutionizing the industry. The use of plywood in furniture making dates back to the 1850s, when flexible plywood was first used to create curved parts. However, it wasn't until the early 20th century that plywood became widely used in furniture production, particularly in the aviation industry. The fuselage of aircraft was one of the first applications of plywood in the industry, with the use of bonded ply-balsa-ply 'sandwich' construction providing exceptional rigidity and strength. This construction method, which involves bonding layers of wood together with adhesives, has since become a standard practice in furniture making.

Aviation-grade plywood, which is manufactured to specifications outlined in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules and MIL-P-607, is a type of plywood that is particularly popular in the furniture industry. This type of plywood is made from African mahogany, spruce, or birch veneers that are bonded together in a hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards sustainable and eco-friendly furniture production. To address this demand, certification programs such as the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), and Greenguard have been established to ensure that production and construction practices are sustainable. Many of these programs offer tax benefits to both the manufacturer and the end user.

Plywood is available in a range of thicknesses and sizes, with the most commonly used thickness range being from 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch. The sizes of the most commonly used plywood sheets are 4 x 8 feet (1220 x 2440 mm), which was first used by the Portland Manufacturing Company. A common metric size for a sheet of plywood is 1200 x 2400 mm. Plywood is also available in specialized sizes for concrete-forming, with sizes ranging from 15 x 24 inches (381 x 610 mm) to 24 x 48 inches (610 x 1220 mm).

In terms of thickness, aircraft plywood is available in thicknesses of 3 ply construction and upwards, with veneers typically ranging from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm in thickness. Thinner veneers, such as 0.1 mm, are also used in the construction of some thinner panels. The use of thinner veneers allows for the creation of lighter and more flexible panels, which can be beneficial in certain furniture applications.

Overall, plywood has been a popular choice in furniture production for over a century due to its strength, versatility, and sustainability. With the rise of certification programs and eco-friendly production methods, plywood is likely to remain a popular choice in the furniture industry for years to come.
r1: Plywood is a material manufactured from thin layers or "plies" of wood veneer that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another. Flexible plywood is designed for making curved parts, a practice which dates back to the 1850s in furniture making. The sizes of the most commonly used plywood sheets are 4 x 8 feet which was first used by the Portland Manufacturing Company, who developed what we know of as modern veneer core plywood for the 1905 Portland World Fair.

a: In a covalent bond, electrons are located between the atoms involved in the bond, and are shared by both atoms. This sharing of electrons is the defining characteristic of a covalent bond, and it is what allows the atoms to form a stable and strong bond. The idea of covalent bonding was first proposed by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916, and the term "covalence" was later introduced by Irving Langmuir in 1919. According to Lewis's theory, atoms form covalent bonds by sharing electron pairs with their neighbors, and this sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain a stable electronic configuration with a full outer shell.

In a covalent bond, the shared electrons are not localized between the atoms, but are delocalized and distributed over the bond. This delocalization of electrons is what allows covalent bonds to be so strong and stable. The delocalization of electrons also allows for the formation of multiple bonds, such as double and triple bonds, which are formed by the sharing of more than two electron pairs between atoms.

The strength of a covalent bond depends on the electronegativity of the atoms involved. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons, and atoms with high electronegativity values are more likely to form covalent bonds with atoms that have lower electronegativity values. This is because the high electronegativity atom will exert a stronger pull on the shared electrons, causing the bond to be stronger.

In summary, electrons in a covalent bond are located between the atoms involved and are shared by both atoms. The delocalization of these electrons allows for the formation of strong and stable bonds, and the strength of the bond depends on the electronegativity of the atoms involved.
r1: A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons in their outer shell, is known as covalent bonding.
r2: A covalent bond is a chemical bond in which electron pairs are shared between atoms. These electron pairs, called shared pairs or bonding pairs, are located in the outer shell of each atom in the bond.

a: The Byzantine Empire began to decline in the 7th century, following the Muslim conquests of the 6th century. During the reign of Maurice (r. 582–602), the Empire's eastern frontier was expanded and the north was stabilized, but his assassination led to a two-decade-long war with the Sassanid Persia, which exhausted the Empire's resources and contributed to significant territorial losses. The Empire lost its richest provinces, Egypt and Syria, to the Arabs in a matter of years. The Macedonian dynasty (10th–11th centuries) saw a brief renaissance for the Empire, but it came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This battle marked the beginning of a period of decline for the Empire, as the Turks settled in Anatolia as a homeland and the Empire lost control of its territories. The Komnenos dynasty in the 12th century managed to restore some stability, but the Empire was eventually captured and partitioned by the Crusaders in the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The Empire was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.

The process of decline for the Byzantine Empire can be traced back to the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, which weakened the Empire and led to significant territorial losses. The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 marked a turning point in the Empire's decline, as it lost control of Anatolia and was unable to recover. The Komnenos dynasty's attempts to restore stability were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Empire was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The decline of the Byzantine Empire was a gradual process that spanned several centuries, marked by a series of territorial losses, political instability, and external threats.
r1: The Byzantine Empire experienced several cycles of growth and decay over the course of nearly a thousand years, including major losses during the Arab conquests of the 7th century. However, modern historians generally agree that the start of the empire's final decline began in the 11th century

Whitesnake's "Still of the Night" features powerful guitar work, and the question of who played those iconic riffs has been a topic of interest among fans. According to David Coverdale, the song was co-written with John Sykes, who also played guitar on the track. However, the song's origins can be traced back to a demo cassette found by Coverdale that he and Ritchie Blackmore had been working on, which was later reworked and became the basis for "Still of the Night." The song was released as the lead single from Whitesnake's self-titled album in 1987 and reached the top 20 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The guitar work on the song is a perfect blend of the blues origins of the band and the more distorted, harder sound that drives the song, making it a standout track in Whitesnake's discography. Interestingly, the song was recorded in Munich after a night of partying, with Coverdale improvising the vocals in a live "jam" style to inspire the band during recording. The final version of the song features guitar work by Sykes, who replaced Mel Galley's guitar parts, as well as drumming by Cozy Powell and bass by Neil Murray. The song's success can be attributed to the combined talents of these musicians, as well as the powerful lyrics and memorable chorus that have made it a fan favorite.

a: The Battle of Blackburn's Ford was a pivotal engagement that took place on July 18, 1861, during the Manassas Campaign of the American Civil War. Union forces under the command of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell attempted to probe the Confederate defenses along Bull Run Creek, but were repelled by Confederate forces led by Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard. The Union brigade, led by Colonel Richardson, was met with heavy fire and retreated, causing a wave of panic to spread through the Union line. The Confederates, led by Colonel Jubal A. Early, took advantage of the confusion and delivered a crushing blow that completed the Confederate victory. The failed reconnaissance-in-force at Blackburn's Ford led McDowell to abandon his plan for a frontal assault and instead attempt to cross the stream beyond the Confederate left flank, which ultimately led to the disastrous defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. The battle at Blackburn's Ford not only gave the Confederates confidence in themselves, but also set the stage for the larger conflict that would unfold in the coming days.

New Zealand first won the America's Cup in 1995, when Team New Zealand, skippered by Russell Coutts, won the challenger series in "NZL 32", a yacht dubbed "Black Magic" due to its black hull and impressive speed. The team then went on to defeat Dennis Connor's Stars & Stripes team 5-0, securing the coveted trophy for New Zealand. This victory marked a significant milestone in the history of the America's Cup, as it was the first time that the cup had been won by a team from outside the United States since the competition began in 1851.

The 1995 America's Cup was notable not only for New Zealand's victory, but also for the controversy that surrounded the event. The defending champion, San Diego Yacht Club (SDYC), had their win overturned on appeal, leading to a reinstatement of the cup for the challenger, Team New Zealand. The controversy continued into the following year, with Fay, the owner of SDYC, appealing to New York's highest court and ultimately losing.

The 1995 victory marked the beginning of a successful era for Team New Zealand, who would go on to defend the cup several times over the next two decades. In 2000, the team, now led by Dean Barker, won the cup again, defeating Italy's Prada Challenge 5-0. However, their eight-year reign came to an end in 2003, when they were defeated 5-0 by Swiss-based challenger Alinghi. Despite this setback, Team New Zealand continues to be a dominant force in the America's Cup, with a loyal fan base and a reputation for innovative design and skilled sailing.

a: The first no-hitter in Orioles history was pitched by Ernie Koob on May 5, 1917, against the Chicago White Sox. This was also the first no-hitter of Koob's career, and he accomplished the feat just one day after his teammate Bob Groom pitched a no-hitter against the same opponent in the second game of a doubleheader. This unique occurrence makes Koob and Groom the only teammates to pitch no-hitters on consecutive days in Major League history. The Orioles, then known as the St. Louis Browns, were a relatively new team at the time, having joined the American League in 1901. They had yet to experience much success, and this no-hitter was a highlight in their early years. The team would go on to experience more success in the 1960s and 1970s, winning three World Series titles, but the no-hitter pitched by Koob remains a significant moment in the team's history.

a: The average life expectancy of a West Highland White Terrier (Westie) is between 12 to 16 years, according to the American breed club, with a median lifespan of 13 years. However, based on a survey conducted by the breed club, the average lifespan is estimated to be around 11.4 years. Veterinary clinic data from the UK suggests a typical lifespan of 10.5 to 15 years, while the French Kennel Club database lists the lifespan as 8 to 16 years. Factors such as training, exercise, and health conditions can affect an individual Westie's lifespan.

As a medium-sized terrier, the Westie is an intelligent and active breed that requires regular training and exercise from a young age to maintain its physical and mental health. The breed is known to be independent and self-confident, but can be stubborn at times, making training a challenge. Socialization and training are essential to develop the Westie's loyal and friendly nature, as well as to prevent behavioral problems.

The Westie's high prey drive and natural instincts to bark and dig holes make it an excellent watchdog, but may require proper management and training to prevent unwanted behaviors. The breed's medium-length double coat requires regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling, but sheds very little.

Health-wise, the Westie is generally a hardy breed, but can be prone to certain health issues such as hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, and patellar luxation. Regular veterinary check-ups and preventative care can help prevent or manage these conditions, ensuring a long and healthy life for your West Highland White Terrier.

a: In the novel "The Day of the Locust" by Nathanael West, the protagonist Tod Hackett is originally from the East Coast, specifically from New England. This is revealed in the text when it states that Tod "had come from the East, from New England, where his family had lived for generations" (West 1). This information is significant because it highlights the contrast between Tod's origins and his current surroundings in Hollywood, California. As a native of the East Coast, Tod brings a different perspective to the glamorous and superficial world of Hollywood, and his outsider status allows him to see the darker underbelly of the city and its inhabitants.

Tod's background also informs his artistic vision and his desire to create something meaningful and authentic in the face of the shallow and commercialized culture of Hollywood. His longing for a more profound connection to life and his frustration with the empty materialism of the Hollywood lifestyle are reflected in his painting, "The Burning of Los Angeles," which he sees as a way to express his disillusionment with the American dream.

The fact that the novel was not well-received during West's lifetime and only gained recognition later, as noted in the factoids, highlights the prescience of West's critique of American society and the enduring relevance of his themes. The novel's exploration of the darker aspects of the American dream and the disillusionment of those who seek to achieve it continue to resonate with readers today, making it a classic of American literature.

In contrast, the Louvin Brothers, while also influential in the country and gospel music genres, are perhaps better known for their unusual album cover art. Their 1959 album, "Satan Is Real," features a plywood rendition of the Devil in a rock quarry, with the brothers standing in front of it. The cover has become an iconic example of religious album art and has been celebrated and parodied on various websites and in popular culture. While the Louvin Brothers are not as widely recognized for their musical contributions as the Everly Brothers, they have still had a lasting impact on the country and gospel music scenes, and their unique album cover art has become a memorable aspect of their legacy.

a: Here's the comprehensive answer to the question "When did George Mason go to the Final Four?" incorporating the given factoid context:

George Mason's most successful run to the Final Four was in 2006, when they made an improbable run as a #11 seed, upsetting #6 seed Wichita State, #3 seed North Carolina, and #2 seed UConn before falling to #1 seed Florida in the Final Four. However, the Patriots have also had success more recently, in the 2010-2011 season, when they were ranked #25 in the country and won the CAA regular season championship. They advanced to the semifinals of the CAA tournament before falling to VCU, but still earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as an #8 seed. In the NCAA tournament, they defeated #9 seed Villanova in a seesaw game before falling to #1 overall seed Ohio State in the third round. This season was highlighted by senior Cam Long being voted first team all-conference and Coach Larrañaga being awarded the CAA Coach of the Year, marking his second time receiving the award. As of February 2011, Coach Larrañaga had 271 career wins at Mason, making him the winningest coach in the history of both the school and the CAA.
r1: The 2005–2006 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team represented George Mason University in the 2005–06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team achieved several milestones, including a team-record 23 regular season wins, and earned an at-large bid to that year's NCAA Tournament. In the NCAA Tournament, the Patriots reached the Final Four, becoming the first team from the Colonial Athletic Association to accomplish that feat.

a: Greenland is the largest island in the world, situated in the continent of North America, specifically in the Arctic region. Although physiographically a part of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe, specifically Norway and Denmark, for over a millennium. The island has a unique history of human settlement, with the Inuit people migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century and gradually settling across the island. With a population of approximately 56,480 people, Greenland is the least densely populated territory in the world, with about a third of the population living in the capital and largest city, Nuuk. The island has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples, with Norsemen settling the southern part of Greenland in the 10th century. Despite its size and historical significance, Greenland is not considered a continental landmass, but rather an island, due to its geographical characteristics and the fact that it is surrounded by water on all sides.
r1: Greenland is the world's largest island, located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium.

a: Network address translation (NAT) is a technique used to conserve global IPv4 address space by remapping one IP address space into another. It works by modifying the IP address information in packets as they pass through a traffic routing device, replacing the original source and destination IP addresses with new ones. This allows a single Internet-routable IP address to be used to represent an entire private network, hiding the private IP addresses of the devices behind it. This technique is commonly used to conserve IPv4 address space, as the limited number of available IPv4 addresses has become a pressing concern. However, NAT has serious consequences on the quality of Internet connectivity, and its implementation can vary widely, affecting network traffic in different ways.

NAT is often used in conjunction with IP masquerading, which hides an entire IP address space behind a single public IP address. In this case, the address that needs to be hidden is changed to the public IP address of the NAT gateway as the "new" source address of the outgoing IP packet, making it appear as if the packet is originating from the NAT gateway rather than the hidden host. This technique is widely used to conserve IPv4 address space and is often referred to simply as "NAT."

The implementation of NAT can have significant consequences on network traffic, and care must be taken to ensure that it is properly configured and managed. NAT can cause issues with network connectivity, including problems with inbound and outbound traffic, and can also affect the ability of certain applications to function properly. As a result, it is important to carefully consider the specific needs of a network and the potential impact of NAT before implementing it. Despite these challenges, NAT remains a popular and essential tool in conserving global IPv4 address space, and ongoing research and development is focused on improving its functionality and addressing its limitations.
r1: Network address translation, or NAT, is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used to avoid the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the networks address space.
r2: In networking, the full form of NAT is network address translation, and in relation to function, NAT is remapping one IP address space into another. This is done by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

a: The highest recorded temperature on Earth is a topic of much debate and scrutiny, with several locations around the world claiming to have reached extreme temperatures. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the highest recorded air temperature on Earth was recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch, California, on July 10, 1913, at 134°F (56.7°C). However, this record has been disputed due to concerns about the accuracy of the measurement, with some historians and weather experts suggesting that the reading may have been influenced by a sandstorm that occurred at the time.

If the 1913 record is decertified, the highest recorded air temperature on Earth would be 129.2°F (54°C), which was recorded in Death Valley, California, on June 20, 2013, and in Mitribah, Kuwait, on July 21, 2016. These readings were taken using standard measuring conditions, 1.5 meters above the ground, and shielded from direct sunlight.

However, when considering ground surface temperatures, the highest recorded temperature is allegedly 201°F (93.9°C), which was recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch on July 15, 1972. This reading was taken using a ground-based thermometer, and while it is not considered an official record by the WMO, it is widely cited as the highest recorded ground surface temperature.

It is important to note that temperature measurements can vary significantly depending on the location and method of measurement. Satellite measurements have captured higher temperatures than ground-based measurements, with a maximum temperature of 70.7°C (159.3°F) recorded in the Lut Desert, Iran, in 2005, using the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite. However, these satellite measurements are considered less reliable than ground-based measurements due to complications involving atmospheric friction.

In summary, while the highest recorded air temperature on Earth is a matter of debate, the highest recorded ground surface temperature is 201°F (93.9°C), recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch, California, in 1972. However, it is important to note that temperature measurements can vary significantly depending on the location and method of measurement, and the accuracy of these readings should be carefully considered when evaluating extreme temperature records.
r1: The highest temperature recorded on Earth has been measured in three major ways: air, ground, and via satellite observation. The former of the three is used as the standard measurement due to persistent issues with unreliable ground and satellite readings. The current official highest registered air temperature on Earth is 56.7 °C (134.1 °F), recorded on 10 July 1913 at Furnace Creek Ranch, in Death Valley in the United States. If this record were to be decertified, then the holder would be a tie at 54.0 °C (129.2 °F), recorded both at Furnace Creek, and in Kuwait. While there is no highest confirmed ground temperature, a reading of 93.9 °C (201.0 °F) was allegedly recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch on 15 July 1972. The hottest recorded satellite temperature on earth is 66.8 °C (152.2 °F).
r2: The highest temperature recorded on Earth has been measured in three major ways: air, ground, and via satellite observation. The current official highest registered air temperature on Earth is 56.7 °C (134.1 °F), recorded on 10 July 1913 at Furnace Creek Ranch, in Death Valley in the United States. If the current record were to be decertified then the holder would be a tie at 54.0 °C (129.2 °F), recorded both at Furnace Creek, and in Kuwait. The highest recorded temperature taken by a satellite is 66.8 °C (152.2 °F), which was measured in the Flaming Mountains of China in 2008. While there is no highest confirmed ground temperature, a reading of 93.9 °C (201.0 °F) was allegedly recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch on 15 July 1972.

a: When do you buy a rosca de reyes? The answer to this question depends on the country and region you are in, as the tradition of eating rosca de reyes, a sweet bread-based ring-shaped dessert filled with guava paste, varies across different cultures and celebrations. In Spain, rosca de reyes are traditionally eaten on January 6, during the celebration of Epiphany, which commemorates the arrival of the three Magi or Wise Men. In some Hispanic communities in the United States, the tradition is also observed. In Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, the day is called "Día de Reyes" and the night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as "Noche de Reyes." Children leave their shoes by the door, along with grass and water for the camels, and wake up early on January 6 to find gifts left by the "Reyes." In Bulgaria, Epiphany is celebrated on January 6 and is known as "Bogoyavlenie" or "Krashtenie Gospodne."

In terms of when to buy a rosca de reyes, it is best to purchase it a few days before January 6, as it is a traditional dessert that is often baked fresh and in limited quantities. Many bakeries and pastry shops offer pre-ordered rosca de reyes, so it is a good idea to place your order in advance to ensure availability. Additionally, some grocery stores may carry pre-made rosca de reyes, so you may be able to find them on sale in the bakery or international foods section.

It's worth noting that the tradition of including a small figure inside the rosca de reyes, such as a baby Jesus or a toy, is not universal and may vary depending on the region. In Spain, for example, it is common to find a small figure inside the rosca de reyes, while in Argentina, there is no such tradition. Ultimately, the best time to buy a rosca de reyes is when it is freshly baked and before it sells out, as it is a popular and delicious dessert that is an important part of many cultural celebrations around the world.
r1: The roscón de reyes is celebrated in Spain and other Hispanic countries, such as Mexico. Recipes vary from country to country and between cultures but tend to be similar.

The stern is technically defined as the area built up over the sternpost, and it is opposite to the bow, the foremost part of the ship. The stern end of a ship is marked with a white navigation light at night. The design of the stern has evolved over time, with two main forms being the "square" or "transom" stern and the "elliptical", "fantail", or "merchant" stern. These designs were developed in that order, with the latter being the most common. The hull sections before the stern are composed of a series of U-shaped rib-like frames set in a sloped or "cant" arrangement, with the last frame before the stern being called the "fashion timber(s)" or "fashion piece(s)". This frame supports the various beams that make up the stern. In 1817, the British naval architect Sir Robert Seppings introduced the concept of the round or "circular" stern, which has since become a popular design.

a: Sure! Here's a comprehensive, well-structured paragraph that answers the question:

"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is a beloved Christmas song that was written by Johnny Marks based on the 1939 story of the same name published by Montgomery Ward. The song was first recorded by crooner Harry Brannon on New York City radio in early November 1949, but it was Gene Autry's version that hit No. 1 on the U.S. charts during Christmas 1949. Autry's recording of the song sold 1.75 million copies its first Christmas season and eventually sold a total of 12.5 million copies, with cover versions bringing the total to over 150 million. The song's success not only helped establish Autry as a popular singer but also gave support to his subsequent Easter song, "Here Comes Peter Cottontail." Interestingly, Autry's version of the song is the only chart-topping hit to fall completely off the chart after reaching No. 1, with the official date of its No. 1 status being the week ending January 7, 1950, making it the first No. 1 song of the 1950s. The song's enduring popularity has led to numerous cover versions and mishearings of the lyrics, including the well-known mondegreen "Olive, the other reindeer" instead of "All of the other reindeer." In December 2018, Autry's version of the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at #36, nearly 70 years after it first charted, further testifying to its timeless appeal.

a: The division of Korea into North and South Korea can be traced back to the end of World War II in 1945, when the Soviet Union occupied the north of the peninsula, and the United States occupied the south, along the 38th parallel. The Allied powers had intended to establish a joint trusteeship over Korea, but the worsening Cold War and the emergence of local political leaders aligned with either the Soviet Union or the United States led to the division of the country. The Soviet Union supported the Korean Communists in the north, while the United States supported the anti-Communist Syngman Rhee in the south. In 1948, UN-supervised elections were held in the south only, resulting in the establishment of the Republic of Korea, while Kim Il-sung was appointed as the leader of North Korea. The subsequent Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a stalemate and left the two Koreas separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to this day. Diplomatic initiatives have failed to end the division, and the two countries remain technically at war. The division of Korea was a direct result of the Cold War and the conflicting interests of the Soviet Union and the United States in the region, and it has had far-reaching consequences for the people of Korea and the geopolitical landscape of East Asia.
r1: The Division of Korea began at the end of World War II in 1945 then in 27 July 1953, South Korea separated from north Korea along the military demarcation line, completing their separation.
r2: There was more than one separation of North Korea and South Korea, one along the 38th Parallel and the other along the Military Demarcation Line. The division of Korea began at the end of World War II in 1945, with North Korea separating from South Korea along the 38th parallel the same year. However, the separation of the countries wasn't completed until 27 July 1953, the day South Korea separated from North Korea along the Military Demarcation Line, the current land border between the countries.

a: The invention of the first handheld camera can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with several pioneers in the field of photography and filmmaking contributing to its development. The first silent film era movie cameras, while portable, were bulky and not practical for use by the cameraman. However, the brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière developed the Cinematograph in the 1890s, which was more compact and could be mounted on a tripod or carried by the cameraman. This camera also served as a film projector. In 1908, Wilbur Wright filmed his flight using a handheld Lumière camera, showcasing the versatility of this new technology.

Thomas Edison developed a portable film camera in 1896, but it was not reliable. Polish inventor Kazimierz Prószyński demonstrated a handheld film camera in 1898, but it was not widely adopted. It wasn't until the early 1900s that handheld cameras became more practical and widely used. Directors Francesco Bertolini and Adolfo Padavan, with assistant director Giuseppe de Liguoro, used handheld cameras to shoot scenes for "L'Inferno" (1911), based on Dante's "The Divine Comedy." This film included innovative camera angles and special effects, showcasing the potential of the handheld camera.

The development of the handheld camera was also influenced by the rise of mass-market photography, made possible by George Eastman's Kodak camera in 1888. This simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed was affordable and accessible to the average consumer. Eastman expanded his lineup to include several models, including both box and folding cameras. In 1900, he introduced the Brownie, a very inexpensive box camera that popularized the concept of the snapshot.

Despite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras remained popular well into the 20th century, offering higher-quality prints. To compete with rollfilm cameras, many inexpensive plate cameras were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available.

In conclusion, the development of the handheld camera was a gradual process that spanned several decades, influenced by advances in mass-market photography and the rise of filmmaking. The Lumière brothers' Cinematograph, Thomas Edison's portable film camera, and the Brownie all played a significant role in the evolution of the handheld camera, paving the way for the versatile and practical cameras used today.
r1: In the 1890s, brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière developed the first fairly compact Cinematograph, which could be mounted on a tripod or carried by the cameraman. The first hand held, sync-sound camera was invented in 1960.
r2: Hand-held camera or hand-held shooting is a filmmaking and video production technique in which a camera is held in the camera operator's hands as opposed to being mounted on a tripod or other base. The first silent film era movie cameras that could be carried by the cameraman were bulky and not very practical to simultaneously support, aim, and crank by hand, so in the 1890s, brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière developed the fairly compact Cinematograph which could be mounted on a tripod or carried by the cameraman, and it also served as the film projector. The first hand held, sync sound camera was invented in 1960. Michel Coutant at Éclair was working with Brault and Rouch's input to create prototypes that eventually led to the self-blimped Eclair 16, the first successful lightweight sync-sound movie camera.

a: The "Hannibal Lecter" franchise, which originated with Thomas Harris' novel "Red Dragon" in 1981, has since expanded into a successful series of films and television shows. The franchise is centered around the brilliant and cannibalistic serial killer, Hannibal Lecter, who has been portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in multiple adaptations. The series began with the 1986 film "Manhunter," directed by Michael Mann, which was an adaptation of "Red Dragon."

a: In the Supernatural TV series, Sam Winchester was brought back from Lucifer's Cage by Crowley, a demon, with the help of his grandfather Samuel, who was also resurrected. This was revealed in the episode "Appointment in Samarra" during the show's sixth season. Crowley had brought back Samuel so that they could help him find Purgatory, the afterlife of monsters, and in exchange, he would return Sam's soul. However, Castiel, an angel and a friend of the Winchester brothers, brought down the protective wall that Crowley had built around Sam's mind, causing him to remember his time in Hell and the torture he endured. This led to Sam struggling with the visions of the Cage and the memories of his soulless self.

It is worth noting that Sam's time in Hell had a profound impact on him, as he was tortured by Lucifer and forced to kill innocent people. This has left him with a deep sense of guilt and a struggle to cope with his actions. Additionally, his experience in Hell has also affected his relationship with his brother Dean, as he is now more withdrawn and distant.

Overall, Sam's journey in the show is one of self-discovery and redemption, as he struggles to come to terms with his past and find a way to move forward. Despite the trauma he has endured, he remains dedicated to helping Dean and others stop the Leviathans and other supernatural threats, and he continues to be a central character in the show.

a: The king size bed, a popular choice for many homeowners, has a fascinating history that spans across different countries and continents. The origins of the king size bed can be traced back to the mid-1950s in the United States, where the bedding industry introduced this larger-than-standard size as a response to the growing demand for more comfortable and spacious sleeping arrangements. Unlike other bed sizes, the king size bed is unique in its implementation, as it is not common to have a king-sized box spring. Instead, two smaller box springs are used under a king-sized mattress. This design choice allows for more support and comfort, especially for taller individuals or those who prefer a more spacious sleeping surface.

The introduction of the king size bed in the United States was a departure from the traditional double size, which had been the standard in English-speaking countries for centuries. The double size, measured at 4 feet 6 inches by 6 feet 3 inches (137 cm x 190 cm), had been the usual citizen's bed in England until the middle of the 19th century. However, with the rise of industrialization and the increasing availability of affordable, high-quality mattresses, the demand for larger and more comfortable beds grew. The king size bed, with its spacious dimensions of 76 inches wide by 80 inches long (193 cm x 203 cm), was a welcome addition to the bedding market.

Despite its widespread popularity in the United States, the king size bed is not a standard size in other countries. In fact, mainland European sizes differ from those in the United States, not only because of the use of the metric system but also due to unique cultural preferences and historical influences. For example, in Japan, the traditional futon mattress is often placed on a tatami mat, which is made of woven grass or straw, and is much larger than the standard king size bed. Similarly, in Australia, the popularity of platform beds and mattresses has led to the development of unique bed sizes, such as the "King Koil" and the "Super King," which are larger than the standard king size but smaller than the California king.

In conclusion, the king size bed, introduced in the mid-1950s in the United States, has become a popular choice for many homeowners seeking more comfort and space in their bedrooms. Its unique design and spacious dimensions have made it a staple in the bedding industry, but its history and popularity vary across different cultures and continents.
r1: The king size bed first came out in the mid-1940s and then became standardized in North America in the 1950s and 1960s.
r2: Standard bed sizes are based on standard mattress sizes, which vary from country to country. The sizes of mattresses use non-numeric labels such as a "king" or "full", but are defined in inches. Historically most beds were "twins" or "doubles" but in the mid-1940s larger mattresses were introduced by manufacturers. These were later standardised as "queen" and "king" in the mid-1950s and 1960s and first made a significant impact on the market during this time period.

a: The excretory system is responsible for removing waste products from the body, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. In marine invertebrates, diffusion through the skin is the primary means of excreting waste products such as ammonia, as they do not have a liver to convert ammonia into urea like mammals do. The skin is also responsible for regulating body temperature and releasing pheromones. In contrast, mammals excrete sweat through sweat glands throughout their body, which helps to regulate body temperature and maintain salt levels. However, the primary function of sweat glands in the excretory system is minimal.

In amphibians, the skin plays a crucial role in excretion, as the lungs are simple and lack the ability to exhale like other tetrapods. The moist, scale-less skin helps to rid the blood of carbon dioxide and allows for urea to be expelled through diffusion when the amphibian is submerged.

The urinary bladder is the primary organ for excreting waste products in the excretory system. It is a hollow, muscular, and distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder through the ureters and exits through the urethra. The bladder is derived from the urogenital sinus and is initially continuous with the allantois. In humans, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis, and it is separated from the rectum by the rectovesical excavation.

One of the main functions of the lungs is to diffuse gaseous wastes, such as carbon dioxide, from the bloodstream as a normal part of respiration. The lungs also play a role in regulating the pH of the blood by removing excess hydrogen ions. The kidneys, on the other hand, are responsible for filtering waste products and excess fluids from the blood and regulating electrolyte levels.

Plasma osmolality is an important factor in the excretory system, as it helps to regulate the amount of water in the body. Increased osmolality in the blood can stimulate the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which results in increased water reabsorption and more concentrated urine. A low serum osmolality, on the other hand, can suppress the release of ADH, resulting in decreased water reabsorption and more concentrated plasma.

In conclusion, the excretory system plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the body by removing waste products and regulating electrolyte levels. Diffusion through the skin and the urinary bladder are the primary means of excreting waste products in marine invertebrates and mammals, respectively. The lungs and kidneys also play important roles in regulating the pH of the blood and filtering waste products from the blood. Plasma osmolality is an important factor in regulating the amount of water in the body and is closely linked to the functioning of the excretory system.
r1: Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide occur in the human excretory system in the lungs, diffusion of salt, water, and waste occur in the kidneys and diffusion of calcium occur in the intestines. In marine invertebrates, diffusion occurs through the skin. And in the amphibian excretory system diffusion also occurs through the skin when submerged.
r2: The excretory system is a passive biological system that removes excess, unnecessary materials from the body fluids of an organism, so as to help maintain internal chemical homeostasis and prevent damage to the body. The kidneys remove from the blood the nitrogenous wastes such as urea, as well as salts and excess water, and excrete them in the form of urine. One of the main functions of the lungs is to diffuse gaseous wastes, such as carbon dioxide, from the bloodstream as a normal part of respiration. Invertebrates lack a liver, but most terrestrial groups, like insects, possesses a number of blind guts that serve the similar functions. Marine invertebrates do not need the ammonia conversion of the liver, as they can usually expel ammonia directly by diffusion through the skin. Most excretion of excess calcium is via the bile and feces, from the intestines, because the plasma calcitriol levels (which ultimately depend on the plasma calcium levels) regulate how much of the biliary calcium is reabsorbed from the intestinal contents.

a: The 2012 film "Snow White and the Huntsman" was primarily filmed in the United Kingdom, with principal photography taking place in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The beach scenes were shot on the Marloes Sands beach near the village of Marloes between September 26 and 29, 2011. While the beach was not closed to the public during filming, certain areas were restricted as filming progressed. To create the computer-generated castle, a special set was built on nearby Gateholm island. Additionally, a field above the beach was used for production purposes, and a wooden ramp was constructed for vehicles and horses to access the beach. The film's production team also consulted with academic experts from the University of Chichester and the University of Oxford to ensure historical accuracy in the film's depiction of fairy tales and medieval battles. The film's soundtrack features an exclusive track by the English band Florence and the Machine, titled "Breath of Life," which was inspired by the character of Queen Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron.

a: Sure, here's a comprehensive answer to the question based on the provided factoids:

The number of teams that can play in the Champions League is determined by a combination of factors, including the association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients and the performance of the teams in previous European competitions. For the 2018-19 season, the top four teams from the leagues of the four top-ranked national associations, as determined by the UEFA country coefficients, will qualify automatically for the group stage. Additionally, the previous season's UEFA Europa League winners will also qualify automatically for the group stage, regardless of their domestic league ranking.

In total, six teams will qualify for the group stage via the qualification rounds, down from ten in the previous season. The remaining 79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations will participate in the qualification rounds, with the exception of Liechtenstein, which does not organize a domestic league.

The Champions League title holders will also qualify for the group stage, regardless of their domestic league ranking. This is a change from previous seasons, where the Champions League title holder would only qualify for the group stage if the berth was vacated.

The 2015-16 Champions Hockey League, a European ice hockey tournament, featured 48 teams from twelve different European first-tier leagues. The teams were decided based on different licenses for the founding teams, leagues, and wildcards. The regular season was expanded to 48 teams, divided into 16 groups with three teams in each group. The two first teams in each group advanced to the play-offs (round of 32), and the group stage began on August 20 and ended on September 6, 2015.

In summary, the number of teams that can play in the Champions League is determined by a combination of factors, including the association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients and the performance of the teams in previous European competitions. The Champions League title holders will also qualify automatically for the group stage, and the remaining teams will participate in the qualification rounds.

a: The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox split, also known as the Great Schism, occurred in the 11th century due to a combination of theological and political differences that had been developing over several centuries. At the heart of the schism were disagreements over the procession of the Holy Spirit, the use of leavened or unleavened bread in the Eucharist, the Bishop of Rome's claim to universal jurisdiction, and the place of the See of Constantinople in the Pentarchy.

One of the key issues was the use of Latin practices in the Greek churches of southern Italy, which were forced to conform to Latin traditions or be closed. In response, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael I Cerularius, ordered the closure of all Latin churches in Constantinople. This led to the papal legate sent by Leo IX refusing to recognize Cerularius as the Ecumenical Patriarch and insisting that he acknowledge the Pope's claim to be the head of all the churches.

These differences had been simmering for centuries, with the Eastern Orthodox churches viewing the Bishop of Rome as having too much authority and the Roman Catholic Church seeing the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as having too much influence. The tensions finally came to a head in 1054, when the papal legate and Cerularius engaged in a heated exchange that ended with the formal schism between the two churches.

The East-West Schism had far-reaching consequences, not only for the two churches but also for the wider Christian world. It marked the beginning of a period of division and isolation for the Eastern Orthodox churches, which would last for centuries. The schism also had significant political implications, as it weakened the influence of the Byzantine Empire and paved the way for the rise of the Latin Empire in the 13th century.

Despite the long history of tensions and disagreements, there have been efforts in recent years to heal the rift between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. In 1988, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Demetrius I, and the Pope John Paul II signed a joint statement acknowledging the shared faith and traditions of the two churches and calling for greater understanding and cooperation. While the schism remains unhealed, these efforts suggest that there may be a way forward towards greater unity and cooperation between the two churches in the future.
r1: In general, the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches split because of theological and political differences. More specifically the disagreements were the procession of the Holy Spirit, whether leavened or unleavened bread should be used in the Eucharist, the Bishop of Rome's claim to universal jurisdiction, and the place of the See of Constantinople in relation to the Pentarchy.
r2: The East–West Schism (also the Great Schism or Schism of 1054) is the break of communion since the 11th century between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. The schism was the culmination of theological and political differences which had developed during the preceding centuries between Eastern and Western Christianity. The specific doctrinal reasons for why the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox church split include the procession of the Holy Spirit, whether leavened or unleavened bread should be used in the Eucharist, the Bishop of Rome's claim to universal jurisdiction, and the place of the See of Constantinople in relation to the Pentarchy.

a: The United States maintains an emergency stockpile of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), located in the Gulf of Mexico. The SPR is stored in four sites, each near a major center of petrochemical refining and processing. The reserve is held in artificial caverns created in salt domes below the surface, which provides a cost-effective and secure storage solution. The caverns are located at depths of up to 1,000 meters below the surface, with average dimensions of 60 meters wide and 600 meters deep. The capacity of each cavern ranges from 10 to 40 million barrels of oil. The SPR has a total storage capacity of 634.8 million barrels, with a maximum removal rate of 4.4 million barrels per day.

The decision to store oil in caverns was made to reduce costs and provide additional advantages such as no leaks and a constant natural churn of the oil due to a temperature gradient in the caverns. The caverns were created by drilling down and then dissolving the salt with water. The SPR management office is located in Elmwood, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans.

The United States has spent almost $4 billion on the facilities and infrastructure of the SPR, and the reserve has been used several times in response to supply disruptions, including during the 1970s oil embargo and more recently in 2011 after Hurricane Katrina. The SPR is managed by the Department of Energy, and the access to the reserve is determined by the conditions written into the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), primarily to counter a severe supply interruption. The price paid for the oil is $20.1 billion, averaging $28.42 per barrel. Purchases of crude oil resumed in January 2009 using revenues available from the 2005 Hurricane Katrina emergency sale.
r1: The United States keep an emergency stockpile of oil in reserves in four locations along the Gulf of Mexico, in Bryan Mound in Freeport, Texas, Big Hill, in Winnie, Texas, West Hackberry in Lake Charles, Louisiana and in Bayou Choctaw in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

a: The last time a $2 bill was printed was in 1996, when the Bank of Canada discontinued the production of the note as part of the transition to the toonie coin. According to the given factoid context, the liability for outstanding provincial and Dominion of Canada notes was transferred to the Bank of Canada in 1935, and liability for chartered bank notes was transferred in 1950. As of December 31, 2016, the total value of outstanding denominations is $1.139 billion, with more than $765 million in $1,000 notes. The Canadian government has announced plans to make all withdrawn banknotes no longer legal tender, but the $2 bill will not be affected at this time.

In the United States, the two-dollar bill was authorized in 1862 and was continuously used until the 1960s, when it was discontinued due to low use and unpopularity. The denomination was resumed in 1976 with a new reverse design, and it has remained a current denomination since then. According to estimates, if the two-dollar bill were to replace half of the one-dollar bills in circulation, the federal government could save approximately $26 million in production, storage, and shipping costs over the period from 1976 to 1981, adjusted for inflation.

In Canada, the $500 note was withdrawn from circulation in 1938, and the $1 note was discontinued in 1989 after the release of the loonie coin. The $2 note was discontinued on February 18, 1996, with the introduction of the toonie coin. None of these withdrawn denominations have been printed since their respective discontinuation dates.

a: The phrase "man's best friend" has a long and fascinating history that dates back thousands of years. The first recorded use of a related phrase is attributed to Frederick the Great of Prussia, but it was likely popularized by the American poet Ogden Nash in the early 20th century. The phrase is a testament to the enduring bond between humans and domestic dogs, which can be traced back to the early days of human civilization.

According to historical accounts, humans and wolves formed a working relationship thousands of years ago, with wolves providing their superior tracking abilities and humans providing their superior hunting skills. This partnership allowed early humans to thrive in their hunting and gathering activities, and over time, the wolves that were most adept at working with humans began to evolve into the domestic dogs we know today.

Before the 19th century, breeds of dogs were largely functional, performing activities such as hunting, guarding, and watching. The language used to describe dogs often reflected these roles, highlighting their importance in human society. However, with the rise of urbanization and the decline of hunting as a primary means of survival, the role of dogs shifted towards companionship and entertainment.

Despite the controversy surrounding the exact nature of the transition from wolves to dogs, one thing is clear: humans and dogs have been inextricably linked for millennia. The phrase "man's best friend" is a testament to this enduring bond, and it continues to be a common colloquialism used to describe the special relationship between humans and their canine companions. Whether through hunting, guarding, or simply providing comfort and companionship, dogs have been an integral part of human society for thousands of years, and their importance cannot be overstated.
r1: The first recorded use of a related phrase to the saying man best friend, is by Frederick the Great of Prussia. It was likely popularized by its use in a poem by Ogden Nash and has since become a common colloquialism.

a: The vein of Mount St. Helens refers to the distinctive pattern of eruptive activity that characterized the volcano's history prior to the catastrophic 1980 eruption. According to the provided factoids, Mount St. Helens experienced two distinct periods of activity, the Kalama cycle and the Goat Rocks cycle. The Kalama cycle, which occurred between 1647 and 1800, was marked by the emplacement of a dacite dome at the summit of the volcano, followed by an andesite lava flow and the formation of a notch in the southeast crater wall. The Goat Rocks cycle, which began in 1800 and lasted for 57 years, also started with an explosion of dacite tephra, followed by an andesite lava flow and the emplacement of a dacite dome. These cycles of activity were characterized by the eruption of dacite lava and the formation of domes at the summit of the volcano.

The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was a significant departure from this pattern of activity, as it was much larger and more destructive than any of the previous eruptions. The eruption began with a massive explosion of dacite tephra, followed by the emplacement of a large andesite lava flow and the destruction of the pre-existing summit cone. The eruption also produced massive ash fall and pyroclastic flows that devastated the surrounding area and caused widespread destruction.

Overall, the vein of Mount St. Helens refers to the pattern of eruptive activity that characterized the volcano's history prior to the 1980 eruption, which was marked by the formation of dacite domes and the eruption of dacite lava. The 1980 eruption was a significant departure from this pattern, and marked a turning point in the volcano's history. The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption's aftermath to be scientifically studied.
r1: Mount St. Helens has erupted multiple times with various VEIs. The 1860 eruption had a VEI of 6, the 1980 eruption had a VEI of 5 and the eruption activity during 2004-2008 had a VEI of 2.
r2: The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions. The scale is logarithmic, with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold increase in observed ejecta criteria, with the exception of between VEI-0, VEI-1 and VEI-2. The VEI of Mount St. Helens during the 1860 BC eruption was 6 and during the 1980 eruption it was 5. The VEI of Mount St. Helens during the 2004-2008 eruption was 2.

a: The federal law providing benefits for the unemployed, known as unemployment insurance, was passed in the United States in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act. The law was enacted during the Great Depression to provide financial assistance to individuals who had lost their jobs due to economic conditions beyond their control. At the time of its implementation, the benefit was criticized by communists, who thought it would prevent workers from starting a revolution, while employers and tories saw it as a "necessary evil." The scheme was based on actuarial principles and was funded by a fixed amount each from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It was restricted to particular industries, particularly more volatile ones like shipbuilding, and did not make provision for any dependants.

In Canada, the system now known as Employment Insurance was formerly called Unemployment Insurance. The name was changed in 1996 to alleviate perceived negative connotations. In 1935, the Employment and Social Insurance Act was passed during the Great Depression by the government of R.B. Bennett as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance program. However, it was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to "Unemployment Insurance" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the Constitution Act, 1867, and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940.

In the United Kingdom, the first unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in 1911 under the Liberal Party government of H. H. Asquith. The National Insurance Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. However, it only applied to wage earners and their families, and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support.

In Argentina, successive administrations have used a variety of passive and active labor market interventions to protect workers against the consequences of economic shocks. In Germany, unemployment insurance was introduced in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the Second World War with the expansion of the welfare state.

Overall, the history of unemployment benefits can be traced back to the early 20th century, with the first schemes being introduced in the United Kingdom and Canada. The concept was later adopted by other countries, including the United States, Germany, and many European nations. Today, unemployment benefits continue to play an important role in providing financial assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs due to economic conditions beyond their control.
r1: The first federal law providing benefits for the unemployed receive royal assent in the UK on 16 December 1911. And Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927. The in 1935, the US federal law providing benefits for the unemployed passed.

Through the Social Security Act of 1935, the federal government of the United States effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.

a: The fur trade in Canada began in the early 16th century, with European traders and Native American tribes exchanging goods and pelts in the pre-Columbian era. The industry gained momentum in the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of French, British, Dutch, and other European traders, who established trading posts and settlements in present-day Canada and the United States. The North American fur trade became a major economic venture, attracting competition among European powers and Native American tribes. Many Native American societies came to depend on the fur trade as their primary source of income, and the industry played a significant role in the early history of contact between Europeans and Native Americans.

The French were among the first Europeans to establish a presence in the fur trade, with traders and missionaries arriving in the 16th century. They established trading posts and settlements in present-day Quebec and the Great Lakes region, and traded with Native American tribes for pelts such as beaver, sea otter, and deer. The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the 17th century, and the Dutch had trade in New Netherland (present-day New York) by the same time. The Russian fur trade also played a significant role in the industry, with traders and settlers establishing themselves in present-day Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.

The fur trade was a lucrative industry, with pelts such as beaver and sea otter in high demand for their valuable fur. The industry also played a significant role in the early history of the United States, with many American settlers and traders involved in the fur trade. However, by the mid-1800s, changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices, and the American Fur Company and other companies failed. Despite this, the legacy of the fur trade continues to be felt in present-day Canada and the United States, with many communities and cultures still connected to the industry and its history.
r1: The fur trade began in North America between Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States, in the pre–Columbian Era. Later in the 1500s, trade between Europeans and First Nations began. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada during the 17th century, while the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland.
r2: The North American fur trade was industry and activity related to the acquisition, trade, exchange, and sale of animal furs in North America. Aboriginal peoples in Canada traded fur among themselves in the pre–Columbian Era. Europeans and First Nations began trading fur in Canada in the 1500s. The French started trading in Canada in the 16th century and the English and Dutch began trading in Canada in the 17th century. Many indigenous peoples depended on the fur trade as their primary source of income.

a: The two types of crust that make up the surface of the Earth are continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust is composed of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks that form the continents and shallow seabed close to their shores, known as continental shelves. It has a bulk composition that is richer in silicates and aluminum minerals and has a lower density compared to oceanic crust. Oceanic crust, on the other hand, is composed of metabasite, which is formed by the cooling and solidification of magma at mid-ocean ridges. It is denser and has a higher concentration of magnesium silicate minerals than continental crust.

The formation of these two types of crust can be traced back to the early stages of planetary accretion, when the terrestrial planets likely had surfaces that were magma oceans. As these cooled, they solidified into crust, which was later modified by erosion, impact cratering, volcanism, and sedimentation. The primary crust, which is the crust that formed during the early stages of planetary accretion, is still debated and its chemical, mineralogic, and physical properties are unknown.

Subduction zone metamorphism is another important process that affects the composition and properties of the crust. Arc magmas are produced by partial melting of metasomatic domains in the mantle wedge, which is reacted with liquid phases derived from dehydration melting of minerals contained in the subducting oceanic crust. This process can lead to the formation of new crust, such as pillow basalts and sheeted dike complexes, as well as the transformation of existing crust through metamorphism.

In conclusion, the two types of crust that make up the surface of the Earth, continental crust and oceanic crust, have different chemical compositions and physical properties and were formed through different geological processes. Understanding the formation and evolution of the crust is essential for understanding the Earth's history and the processes that shape our planet.
r1: Earth has two types of crust, oceanic, made up of primarily mafic rocks, and continental, which is made up of primarily felsic rocks.
r2: Earth has two types of crust, continental and oceanic, which have different chemical compositions and physical properties and were formed by different geological processes. Continental crust is the layer of rocks that forms the continents and continental shelves. It's mostly composed of more felsic rocks, igneous rocks relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz, such as granite. Oceanic crust is primarily more mafic rocks, igneous rocks rich in magnesium and iron, such as basalt, diabase, and gabbro.

a: The lining of the mouth is called the oral mucosa, which is a mucous membrane that covers the inside of the mouth and is composed of two layers: the stratified squamous epithelium and the underlying connective tissue called lamina propria. The oral mucosa is a vital indicator of the body's overall health, as changes in its appearance and function can reveal systemic conditions such as diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or the local effects of chronic tobacco or alcohol use. The oral mucosa can be divided into three main categories based on function and histology: keratinized oral mucosa, nonkeratinized oral mucosa, and specialized oral mucosa.

Keratinized oral mucosa is found in areas of the mouth that are subject to heavy wear and tear, such as the vestibule, the border between the teeth and the cheek, and the hard palate. This type of mucosa has a thick, protective layer of stratified squamous epithelium that is rich in keratin, a protein that provides strength and resilience. Nonkeratinized oral mucosa, on the other hand, is found in areas of the mouth that are less exposed to friction, such as the inner lips, inner cheeks, and the floor of the mouth. This type of mucosa has a thinner layer of stratified squamous epithelium and is more susceptible to inflammation and infection. Specialized oral mucosa is found in areas of the mouth that have specific functions, such as the lingual papillae, which contain taste buds, and the buccal mucosa, which is rich in blood vessels and nerve endings.

In conclusion, the oral mucosa is a complex and vital structure that plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of the mouth. Changes in the oral mucosa can be an important indicator of systemic health, and understanding the different types of oral mucosa and their functions is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases and disorders.
r1: The lining of the mouth is a mucous membrane called the oral mucosa.
r2: The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane lining the inside of the mouth. It comprises stratified squamous epithelium, termed "oral epithelium", and an underlying connective tissue termed "lamina propria".

a: The discovery of electricity cannot be attributed to a single person, as it was a gradual understanding of a natural phenomenon that evolved over thousands of years. Ancient civilizations were aware of the shocking effects of electric fish and the ability of certain objects, such as amber, to attract light objects when rubbed. Thales of Miletus made early observations on static electricity around 600 BC, but it remained an intellectual curiosity until the 17th century when William Gilbert made a careful study of electricity and magnetism. He coined the term "electricus" to describe the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed, which gave rise to the English words "electric" and "electricity."

Despite this early knowledge, practical applications for electricity were limited until the late 19th century, when electrical engineers were able to harness it for industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion of electrical technology during this period transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's versatility and power have made it the backbone of modern industrial society, with applications in transportation, heating, lighting, communications, and computation.

The three white background areas of the flag represent the North, West, and South sides of the city, while the top blue stripe represents Lake Michigan and the North Branch of the Chicago River, and the bottom blue stripe represents the South Branch of the river and the "Great Canal", over the Chicago Portage. One of the stars on the flag commemorates the World's Columbian Exposition, which was held in Chicago in 1893 and featured nearly 200 new buildings, canals, and lagoons, as well as exhibits and works of art inspired by the exposition. The exposition was a symbol of American Exceptionalism and drew over 27 million visitors, setting a world record for outdoor event attendance. The flag's design incorporates elements of the city's geography and history, making it a unique and meaningful symbol of Chicago.
r1: The Chicago flag adopted in 1917 had two stars, until 1933 when it was increased to three. The four star version has existed since 1939.
r2: The flag of Chicago consists of two blue horizontal bars, or stripes, on a field of white, each bar one-sixth the height of the full flag, and placed slightly less than one-sixth of the way from the top and bottom. Four bright red stars, with six sharp points each, are set side by side, close together, in the middle third of the surface of the flag. The City of Chicago's flag was adopted in 1917 after the design by Wallace Rice won a City Council sponsored competition. It initially had two stars, until 1933 when they added another to make three stars and the four star version has existed since 1939.

a: Esther Cleveland, the only child of President Grover Cleveland, was born on September 9, 1893, in the White House, making her the only child of a President to be born there. This unique circumstance was marked by a series of significant events that shaped her life and legacy. In April 1896, Esther contracted measles during an outbreak that spread through the White House, leading to a quarantine. Five years later, she contracted diphtheria, which further highlighted the challenges of growing up in the President's residence. Despite these challenges, Esther made her debut in 1912 and was rumored to be engaged to Randolph D. West, although her relatives denied the engagement. In 1918, she married Captain William Sidney Bence Bosanquet of the Coldstream Guards of the British Army at Westminster Abbey. Her husband, who was the son of a prominent British official, died in 1966. Esther's daughter, Philippa Foot, became a prominent British philosopher.

The film's production was put on hiatus after his death, and the script was rewritten to include his character's death. Sung Kang, who played the character Han Lue, also died in the film, but his death was not related to the real-life accident that occurred during filming.

The scene where both characters die takes place during a high-speed drive through a mountainous terrain. The two characters are driving a car when they lose control and crash into a concrete lamp post and two trees, causing the car to burst into flames. Both characters die from the combined effects of trauma and burns, with their bodies being burned beyond recognition. The scene was shot using a combination of stunt doubles, CGI, and archival footage of Walker and Kang from previous films in the franchise.

The death of Paul Walker was a significant blow to the production of "Furious 7," and it forced the filmmakers to rework the script and incorporate his death into the story. The film was eventually completed and released in 2015, with the death scene becoming one of the most emotional and memorable moments in the movie. Sung Kang's death, on the other hand, was a creative decision made by the filmmakers to further the plot and provide a sense of closure for the character of Han Lue.

Overall, the deaths of Paul Walker and Sung Kang in "Furious 7" added an emotional depth to the film and provided a poignant tribute to the actors and their characters. The film's success and the impact of their deaths have cemented their legacies in the "Fast and the Furious" franchise and in the hearts of fans around the world.

a: The food stamp card, now known as the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, was first introduced in the late 1990s as a replacement for the traditional paper-based Food Stamp Program. The move towards EBT was designed to save the government money by eliminating the need for printing and mailing coupons, make benefits available immediately, and reduce theft and diversion. The first state to implement EBT was Florida in 1998, and by June 2004, all states had adopted the system. The use of EBT cards has since become the standard for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which was renamed from the Food Stamp Program in 2008.

The transition to EBT cards was accompanied by a temporary increase in SNAP benefits during the Great Recession of 2007, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. This increase, which averaged 13.6% funding increase for SNAP recipients, was in effect from April 2009 to November 2013. However, the temporary expansion expired in November 2013, resulting in an average 5% decrease in benefits for SNAP households. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of four decreased from $668 to $632, while the maximum monthly benefit for an individual decreased from $200 to $189.

The EBT card system has been praised for its convenience and efficiency, allowing recipients to purchase food at participating retailers using their card, just like cash. The cards are issued by private contractors and can be used at supermarkets, convenience stores, and other food retailers, including certain farmers' markets. The use of EBT cards has also helped to reduce fraud and abuse, as the cards can be loaded with benefits only for the specific month and the amount of benefits is deducted from the account as purchases are made.

Overall, the transition to EBT cards has been a significant improvement over the traditional paper-based system, providing greater convenience, efficiency, and security for both recipients and retailers. The use of EBT cards has become the standard for SNAP and has helped to ensure that those in need have access to the food they require to lead healthy and productive lives.
r1: In the late 1990s, the Food Stamp Program was revamped, with some states phasing out actual stamps in favor of a specialized debit card system known as Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT). Since June 2004 EBT has been implemented in all states.
r2: In the United States, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, is a federal program that provides food-purchasing assistance for low- and no-income people.The first food stamp card came out in the late 1990s. The food stamp card replaced food stamps in all states in June 2004.

a: The Third Party System in American politics took place during the period from approximately 1896 to 1932, as described by political scientists and historians. This timeframe is also known as the Progressive Era and was characterized by the dominance of the Republican Party, with the exception of the 1912 split when the Democrats held the White House for eight years. The Third Party System was marked by a shift away from the issues of the previous era, such as the American Civil War, Reconstruction, race, and monetary issues, and towards new concerns like progressivism, World War I, and the Great Depression. The period began in the severe depression of 1893 and the intense election of 1896, and ended with the Great Depression, which caused a realignment that led to the Fifth Party System, dominated by the Democratic New Deal Coalition until the 1960s. During this time, the Republican Party was the dominant force in American politics, with the exception of the 1912 split when the Democrats held the White House. The period was marked by significant political and social changes, including the rise of progressivism, the involvement of the United States in World War I, and the onset of the Great Depression.
r1: The third party system took place in American politics between 1854 and the mid-1890s.
r2: The Third Party System is a term of periodization used by historians and political scientists to describe the history of political parties in the United States beginning in 1854 until the end in the mid-1890s, which featured profound developments in issues of American nationalism, modernization, and race.

a: The financial crisis of 2007-2008, also known as the global financial crisis, began in 2007 with a crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the United States. The crisis started when homeowners who had taken out subprime mortgages, which were adjustable-rate loans that reset to much higher interest rates, began defaulting on their mortgages in large numbers. This led to a sharp increase in foreclosures, which caused a decline in housing prices and a loss of value in the mortgage-backed securities that had been sold to investors around the world. The crisis then spread to the financial sector, as many banks had invested heavily in these securities and were facing significant losses. The collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, marked a turning point in the crisis, as it caused a loss of confidence in the financial system and led to a freeze in the credit markets. This had a ripple effect throughout the global economy, leading to a sharp contraction in economic activity and a severe recession. The crisis was exacerbated by excessive risk-taking by banks, and the failure of regulators to effectively oversee the financial system. The crisis was eventually contained through massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies, but not before it had caused widespread damage to the global economy and financial system. The crisis led to a global economic downturn, known as the Great Recession, and was followed by a crisis in the banking system of the European countries using the euro, known as the European debt crisis. In response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in the US to promote financial stability, and the Basel III capital and liquidity standards were adopted by countries around the world to prevent a similar crisis from happening again.
r1: In April 2007 the depreciation in the subprime mortgage market initiated the financial crisis. This crisis later turned into a full-blown international banking crisis by September 15, 2008, because of the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.
r2: The 2008 financial crisis began and started developing into an international banking crisis on different dates and after different events. It actually started happening in April 2007 when the 2007 depreciation in the subprime mortgage market occurred.

a: It Came from Outer Space, a 1953 science fiction horror film directed by Jack Arnold and produced by William Alland, was filmed on location in California and on Universal's sound stages. The film's script, based on Ray Bradbury's original story treatment, tells the story of an astronomer and his fiancée who discover a crashed alien spaceship in the desert, leading to strange occurrences and hostile disbelief from the local community. The film's unique approach to portraying alien "invaders" as stranded and non-threatening beings was a deliberate choice by Bradbury, intended as a metaphorical refutation of xenophobia and the Cold War. Filming took place in and around the California towns of Palmdale, Victorville, and the Mojave Desert, as well as on Universal's sound stages, with an uncredited music score composed by Irving Gertz, Henry Mancini, and Herman Stein. The film's use of location shooting and sound stage filming allowed for a blend of realistic settings and atmospheric suspense, contributing to its enduring popularity as a classic of the science fiction horror genre.

a: The scroll wheel, a ubiquitous feature on modern computer mice and some keyboards, has its roots in the hamster wheel. The earliest recorded use of the term "hamster wheel" dates back to a 1949 newspaper advertisement. The concept of providing a running surface for rodents in confined spaces has been around for decades, with hamster wheels made of steel or plastic being the most common. These wheels are designed to allow rodents to exercise and run even when their living space is limited.

The idea of incorporating a similar mechanism into computer mice can be traced back to the 1990s, when Eric Michelman and Chris Graham developed the concept of a scroll wheel as part of the Microsoft IntelliMouse. The scroll wheel was designed to provide a more intuitive way of scrolling through documents and web pages, allowing users to quickly and easily navigate large amounts of content. This innovation was met with great success, and soon other computer peripheral manufacturers began incorporating scroll wheels into their products.

In the 21st century, scroll wheels have become less common on laptop computers, replaced by touchpads with multitouch capability. These touchpads often have built-in scrolling gestures, allowing users to scroll through content by touching and dragging their fingers on the pad. This has made up for the lack of a physical scroll wheel, providing a similar functionality in a more compact and portable form factor.

However, the concept of the scroll wheel has not been limited to computer mice and keyboards. The idea of providing a running surface for rodents in confined spaces has been applied to the design of hamster wheels, which are now available in a variety of sizes and materials. These wheels are designed to provide a safe and comfortable running surface for hamsters and other small animals, allowing them to exercise and stay healthy in their living spaces.

In conclusion, the scroll wheel has a rich history that spans from the humble beginnings of hamster wheels to the modern computer peripherals of today. The innovation of the scroll wheel has revolutionized the way we interact with computer content, providing a more intuitive and efficient way of scrolling through documents and web pages. Its impact can be seen not only in the computer industry but also in the design of hamster wheels, which continue to provide a safe and comfortable running surface for small animals.
r1: In computer mice, the wheel in the middle is generally used for scrolling. But for mice, as in the animal, they often have a wheel in the middle of their cage for running.
r2: There are several reasons why a mouse has a wheel in the middle. This could refer to a computer mouse, which has a scroll wheel used for scrolling. It is usually located between the left and right mouse buttons and is positioned perpendicular to the mouse surface. This could also refer to a wheel in a mouse cage, or a hamster wheel or running wheel which are exercise devices used primarily by hamsters and other rodents.

a: The Green Bay Packers, led by head coach Hank Stram, won the first Super Bowl in 1967, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 35-10. The Packers, who had previously won the NFL Championship in 1960 and 1961, were considered the favorites going into the game due to their strong defense, which was led by All-AFL safeties Johnny Robinson and Bobby Hunt, and defensive back Fred Williamson. The team also had a strong offense, with quarterback Bart Starr and running back Jim Taylor, who combined for 300 yards and five touchdowns in the game.

The Chiefs, who had won the AFL Championship the previous week, were led by quarterback Len Dawson and had a strong offense of their own, but they were unable to keep up with the Packers' pace. The game was played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in front of a sparse crowd of 15,062, and the East team dominated the West team in the 1967 Pro Bowl, which was played the week before Super Bowl I. The East team, coached by Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys, recovered two fumbles and intercepted four passes, while the West team, coached by George Allen of the Los Angeles Rams, was unable to capitalize on their opportunities.

Super Bowl I was the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game, and it was played with considerable animosity between the two rival leagues. Many sports writers and fans believed that the NFL was superior to the AFL, and expected the Packers to blow out the Chiefs. However, the game was competitive in the first half, with the Chiefs outgaining the Packers in total yards, but Green Bay pulled away in the second half to secure the victory. The game proved to be a turning point in the history of professional football, as it marked the beginning of the AFL-NFL merger and the eventual rise of the Super Bowl as one of the most popular sporting events in the world.
r1: In the 1967 Super Bowl, the National Football League champion Green Bay Packers won the game, led by coach Vince Lombardi.

a: The concept of the "Armor of God" is discussed in the Bible, specifically in the book of Ephesians, where it is stated that believers should "put on the whole armor of God" in order to stand against the schemes of the devil (Ephesians 6:11). This metaphorical armor is not just physical armor worn by God, but rather a spiritual armor that represents the virtues and attributes of God that believers can put on to protect themselves from the evil one. The armor includes truth, righteousness, preparation of the Gospel of peace, faith, salvation, and the Word of God and prayer. This armor is available to believers because it is God's own armor, and He is the Divine Warrior who fights on behalf of His people (Isaiah 59:16-19). The use of the imagery of armor in this context emphasizes the idea that believers are engaged in a spiritual battle against the forces of evil, and that they must be equipped with the full armor of God in order to stand against these forces and emerge victorious. The armor of God is not just a passive protection, but an active weapon that believers can use to fight against the evil one and live a life of righteousness and faith.
r1: The Armor of God is mentioned in multiple Biblical scriptures. It is derived from Ephesians 6:11 and is also mentioned in Wisdom 5:17–20.
r2: Scripture in both Ephesians and Wisdom talks about the whole armor of God. The Scripture in Ephesians that does is Ephesians 6:11. Ephesians 6:10–11 is the sixth and last chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, the tenth book in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The Scripture Wisdom 5:17–20 in The Book of Wisdom, one of the seven Sapiential or wisdom books in the Septuagint, also talks about the whole armor of God.

The 2011 Burkinabé protests were a series of popular demonstrations that took place in the country, sparked by a mutiny among soldiers in the capital city of Ouagadougou over unpaid housing allowances. The protests quickly spread to other parts of the country, including the town of Pô in southern Burkina Faso, and were fueled by grievances over rising prices, the death of a student in police custody, and the shooting of other protesters. The protests were marked by widespread violence and destruction of property, including the burning of the house of the mayor of Koudougou and several shops. The protests ultimately led to the resignation of President Blaise Compaoré, who had been in power for 27 years. The events in Burkina Faso were seen as a potential "Burkinabè Spring" or Arab Spring-style uprising, and were closely watched by the international community.

a: Based on the provided factoids, the winner of the 2017 St. Petersburg, Florida mayoral election was incumbent mayor Rick Kriseman, who won the re-election on November 7, 2017. Kriseman, a Democrat, defeated his opponent and former mayor Rick Baker, a Republican, in the general election. The election was officially non-partisan. Kriseman won the election by a 10-point margin in 2013, and he opted to seek re-election in 2017. In the primary election held on August 29, 2017, Kriseman advanced to the general election along with Baker, who filed for re-election in May 2017. The election was marked by a contentious campaign, with Kriseman focusing on issues such as affordable housing and Baker emphasizing his experience as a former mayor.

Kriseman's victory in the 2017 election can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, he was able to capitalize on his incumbency and the positive perception of his performance in his first term. According to the factoids, 70% of voters approved of the direction the city was heading under Kriseman's leadership, which likely helped him maintain support among voters. Additionally, Kriseman's focus on issues such as affordable housing and his efforts to address the city's homelessness crisis may have resonated with voters, particularly in light of the city's growing affordability crisis.

On the other hand, Baker's campaign may have been hurt by his previous tenure as mayor, which ended in 2010. The factoids suggest that Baker's 2001-2010 tenure as mayor was marked by controversy, including allegations of corruption and a contentious relationship with the city council. This may have made it difficult for him to gain traction among voters, particularly in light of Kriseman's positive performance in his first term.

Overall, Kriseman's victory in the 2017 St. Petersburg, Florida mayoral election can be attributed to a combination of his incumbency, his focus on issues that resonated with voters, and the controversies surrounding his opponent's previous tenure as mayor.
r1: In 2009, Bill Foster won the St. Petersburg, Florida mayoral election. Then in both 2013 and 2017 elections, Richard David "Rick" Kriseman won.

a: The draft for the Vietnam War began on December 1, 1969, with the Selective Service System conducting two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service for men born between January 1, 1944, and December 31, 1950. This marked the first time a lottery system was used to select men for military service since World War II. The lottery was established to address perceived inequities in the draft system and to provide more military personnel for the Vietnam War.

The roots of the Vietnam War can be traced back to the end of World War II, when Japan left Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai as the head of the country. Ho Chi Minh, a communist leader who sought independence for all of Vietnam, took advantage of Bao Dai's weakness and successfully took over Hanoi and most of northern Vietnam. The French, who had colonial rule over Vietnam, returned to the country and set up the State of Vietnam with support from the United States. The Viet Minh, a communist-led organization, resisted French rule and eventually defeated them in 1954.

After the French defeat, the Viet Minh set up the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and Emperor Bao Dai established the State of Vietnam in the south, with support from the United States. The division of the country into two separate states led to a protracted conflict known as the First Indochina War, which lasted from 1946 to 1954. The conflict ended with the signing of the Geneva Accords, which called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of French and Viet Minh forces from Indochina.

However, the division of Vietnam into two states did not bring peace, and the conflict escalated into the Vietnam War, which began in the early 1960s. The United States became increasingly involved in the conflict, with President John F. Kennedy sending military advisers to South Vietnam in 1961. The U.S. involvement in the war increased under President Lyndon B. Johnson, who deployed ground troops to South Vietnam in 1965.

China played a significant role in the Vietnam War, supporting North Vietnam with financial aid, military equipment, and troops. China's support for North Vietnam was justified as a response to "American aggression in the guise of the UN." China's involvement in the war included sending anti-aircraft units and engineering battalions to North Vietnam to repair damage caused by American bombing and to support North Vietnamese army units in combat in the South. China's military claims to have caused 38% of American air losses in the war.

The draft lottery of 1969 was a significant event in the Vietnam War, as it marked the first time a lottery system was used to select men for military service. The lottery was intended to address perceived inequities in the draft system and to provide more military personnel for the war effort. The lottery resulted in the call-up of hundreds of thousands of young men to serve in the military, many of whom were sent to fight in Vietnam. The draft lottery and the Vietnam War remain controversial events in American history, with many Americans opposing the war and the draft as a violation of their civil liberties and a misguided use of military force.
r1: The draft for the Vietnam War started in France in 1954, in China in 1962 and in the United States on December 1, 1969.
r2: On December 1, 1969 the Selective Service System of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the Vietnam War, and it was the first time a lottery system had been used to select men for military service since 1942. The first draft for the Vietnam War in France was in 1954 as part of the Geneva Accords and was negotiated by French prime minister Pierre Mendès France and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. The first draft for the Vietnam War in China was in the summer of 1962.

a: During a solar eclipse, the moon is located in the position of blocking the direct sunlight from reaching the Earth, thereby causing a partial or total obscuration of the sun's image. This occurs when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned in a straight line, known as a syzygy, during a new moon when the Moon is near the ecliptic plane. However, the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so its shadow usually misses Earth. Special conditions must occur for the two events to coincide, as the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at its orbital nodes twice every draconic month (27.212220 days) while a new moon occurs one every synodic month (29.530587981 days).

The solar eclipse of April 8, 2005, was a total solar eclipse that was visible in a narrow path across the Pacific Ocean, starting from south of New Zealand and ending in the extreme northwestern part of South America. The path of the eclipse was a diagonal line across the Pacific Ocean, and the total solar eclipse was not visible on any land, while the annular solar eclipse was visible in Southern tip of Puntarenas Province of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela. This hybrid event began and ended as an annular eclipse, with totality occurring in a narrow path across Earth's surface.

In summary, during a solar eclipse, the moon is located in the position of blocking the direct sunlight from reaching the Earth, and its position is influenced by its orbit around the Earth, which is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The specific location of the moon during a solar eclipse depends on the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth, and special conditions must occur for the two events to coincide.
r1: A solar eclipse is when a part of the Earth is covered by a shadow that is cast by the moon. The moon would be in a new moon phase, positioned between Earth and the sun.
r2: During a solar eclipse, the moon is between Earth and the sun. In terms of phases, the moon is in the new moon phase during a solar eclipse.

a: The Confederate forces claimed victory at the First Battle of Bull Run, also known as the First Battle of Manassas. Despite the Union's forces being slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements to arrive by rail, the Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard emerged victorious. The Union's forces, led by Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, were poorly trained and poorly led, which contributed to their defeat. The Confederate victory was not fully pressed by Beauregard and Johnston, despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had arrived on the battlefield. The Union's retreat was disorganized, with many soldiers abandoning their weapons and equipment, and hundreds were taken prisoner. The wealthy elite of nearby Washington, who had come to picnic and watch the battle, were caught off guard and had to flee in their carriages, blocking the roads back to Washington. The battle marked the first major conflict of the American Civil War and set the stage for future battles, including the Second Battle of Manassas and the Siege of Petersburg.
r1: The Confederacy led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis won the Battle of Bull Run, with military commanders P. G. T. Beauregard, Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson and Joseph E. Johnston.

a: After World War II, Germany was obligated to pay significant reparations to the Allied powers, as determined by the Potsdam Conference and the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947. The Morgenthau Plan, which aimed to transform Germany into an agrarian society, and the French Monnet Plan, which sought to transfer the Ruhr Area to France, were among the early proposals for post-war Germany. However, these plans were ultimately rejected in favor of the London Agreement on German External Debts, also known as the London Debt Agreement, in 1953. This agreement resolved the issue of war reparations and established a framework for Germany's post-war economic recovery.

Despite this, the issue of reparations has continued to be a source of tension between Germany and its neighboring countries, particularly Poland. In 2017, comments made by Polish government officials from the Law and Justice political party reignited the debate over reparations. The German government has maintained that the issue was resolved in 1953, but Polish commentators have countered that the then Polish government was under Soviet control and that its refusal of reparations was not binding.

In addition to the monetary reparations, Germany also paid reparations in the form of industrial equipment and forced labor. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia received a value of US$36 million in industrial equipment from dismantled German factories, and West Germany paid 8 million German marks as reparations for forced human experimentation on Yugoslav citizens. The Yalta Conference also stipulated that no reparations would be paid in money, instead, much of the value consisted of German industrial assets, as well as forced labor to Russia.

Moreover, the Soviet Union annexed the German territories east of the Oder-Neisse, leading to the expulsion of 12 million Germans. These territories were incorporated into communist Poland and the Soviet Union, respectively, and resettled with citizens of these countries. The legacy of these events continues to have an impact on the political and economic relations between Germany and its neighboring countries, and the issue of reparations remains a contentious topic to this day.
r1: After World War II ended, Germany had to pay reparations to the Allies. These payments weren't paid in currency, but in German industrial assets, as well as forced labour to the Allies.
r2: After World War II both West Germany and East Germany were obliged to pay war reparations to the Allied governments, according to the Potsdam Conference. According to the Yalta Conference, no reparations to Allied countries would be paid in money. Instead much of the value transferred consisted of German industrial assets, as well as forced labour to the Allies.

a: The Socratic method, as employed by the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, involved the use of question and answer dialogues to arrive at important truths and to foster critical thinking and self-examination. According to the context, Socrates claimed that the chief goodness consists in the care of the soul concerned with moral truth and moral understanding, and that life without examination is not worth living. The Socratic method was used to break down the theories we hold, to go beyond the axioms and postulates we take for granted, and to arrive at a deeper understanding of the truth. This method involved asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. It is a dialectical method, involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned, and one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point. The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. It searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs.

In the context of ancient Greek philosophy, the Socratic method was used by Plato and his student Aristotle to lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Plato's sophistication as a writer is evident in his Socratic dialogues, which demonstrate the use of the Socratic method to break down and examine theories and beliefs. The Socratic method is not just a means of arriving at answers, but also a way of fostering critical thinking and self-examination. It is a "left hand" path to good and wisdom, while myth is the "right hand" path. The use of the Socratic method in ancient Greek philosophy highlights the importance of critical thinking and self-examination in the pursuit of truth and wisdom.
r1: The Socratic method, that uses questions and answers to arrive at important truths, was named after and developed by Greek philosopher Socrates. This method was famously used by Socrates' student, Plato.
r2: Socrates was the first to attempt the question and answer method of arriving at important truths by engaging in discussions with his fellow Athenians. Plato later put Socrates' methodology into writing and formalized it.

a: What is it called when you mix up the letters of a word?

When you mix up the letters of a word, it is called an anagram. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word "anagram" can be rearranged into "nag a ram", or the word "binary" into "brainy". The original word or phrase is known as the "subject" of the anagram.

Anagrams can be a fun and creative way to play with language, but they can also be a challenge for individuals with dyslexia. Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects an individual's ability to process and understand written language, and can cause difficulties with phonological processing, decoding, and spelling. Individuals with dyslexia may struggle with mixing up the letters of words, as well as with other aspects of language processing.

Anagrams can be a useful tool for individuals with dyslexia to practice their language skills, as they can help to improve phonological awareness and decoding abilities. For example, an anagram of the word "animal" is "aminal", which can help individuals with dyslexia to practice recognizing the letters "a", "n", and "l" in different positions within a word. Additionally, anagrams can be a fun and engaging way to practice language skills, as they can be used to create clever and creative phrases or sentences.

Overall, anagrams are a useful tool for individuals with dyslexia to practice their language skills, and can be a fun and creative way to play with language. However, it is important to note that anagrams should be used in conjunction with other language interventions and strategies to help individuals with dyslexia to improve their language skills.
r1: In regard to phonetics, when a word or phrase is formed by mixing up or rearranging the letters of a word, it is called an Anagram. But when someone has a disorder where they accidentally get letters or sounds mixed up or reversed, it is call Dyslexia.
r2: Mixing up the letters of a word can happen for various reasons. An "anagrammatist" creates anagrams, a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject. On the other hand, some people may have dyslexia, a disorder characterized by problems with the visual notation of speech. People with dyslexia may reverse the order of two letters especially when the final, incorrect, word looks similar to the intended word.

a: The longest recorded home run in Major League Baseball (MLB) history was hit by Roger Maris in 1961, measuring 61 degrees (221 feet) and landing in the lower deck of the old Yankee Stadium. However, this record has been disputed, and some argue that the longest home run was hit by Dale Long in 1956, who hit eight home runs in eight consecutive games, a feat that has only been matched by Don Mattingly in 1987 and Ken Griffey, Jr. in 1993.

Long's impressive streak began on May 19th, 1956, when he hit a home run off the Chicago Cubs' pitcher, Bob Buhl, at Wrigley Field in Chicago. He continued to hit home runs in every game for the next eight games, including two more against the Cubs, one against the St. Louis Cardinals, and five against the New York Giants. Long's remarkable achievement was not only a record for the most consecutive games with a home run but also a testament to his exceptional skill as a hitter.

Despite the impressive record, Long's achievement has been somewhat overshadowed by the legendary Babe Ruth, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players of all time. However, Long's record is a reminder that there have been other talented hitters in MLB history, and his achievement is an important part of the sport's rich history.

In conclusion, while the longest recorded home run in MLB history is a matter of debate, Dale Long's impressive streak of eight home runs in eight consecutive games is a remarkable achievement that deserves recognition. Long's skill as a hitter and his place in MLB history are a testament to the enduring appeal of America's favorite pastime.
r1: The teams that have hit recorded breaking home-run in MLB history are New York Highlanders, Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees. The player that has hit the longest recorded homerun in MLB history is Babe Ruth.

a: Thomas Robert Malthus's seminal work, "An Essay on the Principle of Population," published in 1798, profoundly impacted the understanding of population growth and its consequences. The book posited that population would increase geometrically, doubling every 25 years, while food production would only grow arithmetically, leading to inevitable famine and starvation. This prediction fueled debate about the size of the population in the Kingdom of Great Britain and contributed to the passing of the Census Act 1800, enabling the first national census in England, Wales, and Scotland in 1801. The book's 6th edition (1826) was influential in the development of the theory of natural selection by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, with a key portion of the book dedicated to what is now known as Malthus' Iron Law of Population. This concept, derived from Goethe's "great, eternal iron laws," highlights the inevitable relationship between population growth and resource scarcity, which remains a pressing concern in modern times. Malthus' work, though not the first on population, has been acknowledged as the most influential of its era, shaping the discourse on population growth and its implications for centuries to come.
r1: The book An Essay on the Principle of Population was first published anonymously in 1798, but the author was soon identified as Thomas Robert Malthus.
r2: The book An Essay on the Principle of Population was first published anonymously in 1798, but the author was soon identified as Thomas Robert Malthus. The book warned of future difficulties, on an interpretation of the population increasing at a geometrical ratio while an increase in food production was limited to an arithmetic ratio, which would leave a difference resulting in the want of food and famine, unless birth rates decreased.

a: The development of the first alternating current (AC) electric system can be traced back to the work of several inventors and engineers in the mid-19th century, particularly in Europe. The first alternator to produce AC was a dynamo electric generator constructed by the French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, which was later improved with the addition of a commutator to produce direct current (DC). However, the first practical application of AC was not seen until the 1850s, when Guillaume Duchenne, an inventor and developer of electrotherapy, announced that AC was superior to DC for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.

In the following decades, AC technology continued to develop in Europe, particularly through the work of the Hungarian Ganz Works company, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, Lucien Gaulard, and Galileo Ferraris. In 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system using sets of induction coils installed along a high voltage AC line. However, it was not until the Ganz Works electrified a large European metropolis, Rome, in 1886, that the reliability of AC technology received a significant boost.

In the United States, William Stanley, Jr. designed one of the first practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits, using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core. This design, called an induction coil, was an early transformer, and Stanley also worked on adapting European designs for US entrepreneur George Westinghouse, who started building AC systems in 1886.

The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a public campaign, known as the "War of Currents," in 1887, led by Thomas Edison, who advocated for direct current (DC) as safer and more practical. However, the introduction of a functional AC motor, independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, and further developed by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown, gave AC systems the practicality they needed to gain widespread acceptance. The Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant (spring of 1891) and the original Niagara Falls Adams Power Plant (August 25, 1895) were among the first hydroelectric AC power plants.

In conclusion, the development of the first AC electric system was a gradual process that involved the contributions of several inventors and engineers over several decades. The technology gained practicality and acceptance through the development of functional AC motors and the widespread adoption of AC systems in the late 19th century.
r1: The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by Guillaume Duchenne,. The first alternator to produce alternating current was a dynamo electric generator based on Michael Faraday's principles constructed by the French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. The first alternating current electric arc lighting system was developed by Pavel Yablochko. And the first induction motor that was an alternating current power system was made by Nikola Tesla.

The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by Guillaume Duchenne, inventor and developer of electrotherapy. In 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high voltage AC line that instead of changing voltage, the primary windings transferred power to the secondary windings which were connected to one or several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design. In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional AC motor, something these systems had lacked up till then and the design, an induction motor, was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US).

a: The fish used in McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich is Alaska pollock, although the specific type of fish may vary depending on the location. In the past, McDonald's has used hoki and Atlantic cod, but due to declining fish populations and sustainability concerns, the company has shifted its focus to Alaska pollock. The use of Alaskan pollock has been certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), an international organization that sets standards for sustainable fishing practices. However, even this fish source is facing challenges, as the MSC has placed the Alaskan pollock fisheries in a re-assessment program due to declining catch numbers and by-catch problems with salmon. Despite these challenges, McDonald's has committed to maintaining its focus on sustainable fishing practices and has updated its packaging and promotion to reflect this commitment. The Filet-O-Fish sandwich consists of a battered and fried fish fillet, steamed bun, tartar sauce, and processed American cheese, and is a popular menu item for McDonald's customers.
r1: In November 2007, McDonald's lowered the use of New Zealand hoki in their Filet-O-Fish sandwich and increased the use of Alaskan pollock, the fish that is used the US Filet-O-Fish.
r2: The Filet-O-Fish is a fish sandwich sold by the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald's. Alaska pollock is commonly used in the fast food industry in products such as McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich and Fish McBites.

a: The construction of the Great Wall of China can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) and the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), when various states built fortifications to protect themselves against nomadic invasions from the north. However, it was not until the reign of the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, that the walls were connected and expanded to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) against these threats. The Great Wall was built using forced labor and rammed earth, and by 212 CE, it stretched from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.

Subsequent dynasties had different policies regarding northern frontier defense, with some, like the Han (202-220 CE), the Northern Qi (550-574 CE), and the Sui (589-618 CE), rebuilding, re-manning, and expanding the walls. The Han extended the fortifications further west, while the Qi built new walls. The Sui mobilized over a million men in their wall-building efforts. On the other hand, the Tang (618-907 CE), the Song (960-1279 CE), the Yuan (1271-1368 CE), and the Qing (1644-1911 CE) did not build frontier walls, instead relying on military campaigns and diplomacy to address the threat from Inner Asia.

Overall, the history of the Great Wall of China reflects the complex and evolving strategies employed by Chinese dynasties to protect their borders and maintain control over their territories. While the wall has undergone numerous expansions and renovations over the centuries, its original purpose remains the same: to safeguard the Chinese heartland from the threats of nomadic invasions.
r1: The construction of Great Wall of China began in 771 BC with fortifications built by various states, then in 221 BC the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang had them connected.
r2: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn ,771 BC through 476 BC, and Warring States periods 475–221 BC, were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty 221–206 BC, against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labor, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria. The official order to start building the wall was in 221 BC.

a: The Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States. However, the statue was not originally intended to represent the United States, but rather the idea of liberty and freedom. The statue was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and was a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States. The statue was inspired by the Roman goddess Libertas, who was a personification of freedom and liberty. The statue's design was influenced by the Great Seal of France, which features an image of Libertas, and was intended to symbolize the idea of liberty enlightening the world.

The idea of the statue was first proposed in 1865 by Édouard de Laboulaye, a French political thinker and abolitionist, as a gift to the United States to commemorate the 100th anniversary of American independence. Bartholdi was commissioned to design the statue, and he spent several years working on the project. The statue was completed in France in 1884 and was disassembled and shipped to the United States, where it was reassembled on Bedloe's Island (now Liberty Island) in New York Harbor. The statue was officially dedicated on October 28, 1886.

The statue's design was intended to represent the idea of liberty enlightening the world, and it has become a symbol of hope and freedom for millions of people around the world. The statue's pedestal is inscribed with the words "Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" from Emma Lazarus's sonnet "The New Colossus." These words have become an iconic representation of the American dream and the idea of freedom and opportunity for all.

In conclusion, the Statue of Liberty was not intended to represent the United States, but rather the idea of liberty and freedom. The statue's design was inspired by the Roman goddess Libertas and was intended to symbolize the idea of liberty enlightening the world. The statue has become an iconic symbol of hope and freedom for millions of people around the world and is a powerful reminder of the American dream and the idea of freedom and opportunity for all.

a: The 1990s saw a significant shift in the country music landscape, with the rise of alternative country, a genre that eschewed the polished production values and pop-influenced sound of mainstream country music. This movement was led by a diverse group of artists such as Old 97's, Steve Earle, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket, Blitzen Trapper, and Drive-By Truckers. These musicians embraced a lo-fi sound infused with punk and rock & roll elements, and often incorporated bleak, gothic, and socially aware lyrics. Despite the emergence of these alternative acts, the decade also saw the passing of several notable country music legends, including Twitty, Webb Pierce, Dottie West, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Roger Miller, Roy Acuff, Charlie Rich, Minnie Pearl, Faron Young, John Denver, Carl Perkins, Grandpa Jones, Tammy Wynette, Eddie Rabbitt, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Rex Allen, and Hank Snow.

Despite the loss of these icons, the 1990s were a transformative time for country music, with the rise of alternative country challenging the dominant Nashville-based industry and pushing the genre in new and innovative directions. According to "Billboard" magazine, Mariah Carey was named the best Artist of the Decade for the 1990s, with Janet Jackson following closely behind. These two artists, along with the alternative country movement, helped to shape the sound and direction of country music in the 1990s, creating a diverse and dynamic decade for the genre.
r1: The artist that had most musical hits from the 1990s is Mariah Carey. And player with the most hits in baseball in the 1990s was Mark Grace.
r2: In the 1990s, Mariah Carey had the highest number of top hits on the top 100 Billboard charts, while Mark Grace had the most hits in baseball.

a: Based on the provided factoid context, the player who has scored the most own goals in the Premier League is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that it is likely to be a player from one of the teams that finished at the bottom of the table, as these teams tend to have more own goals due to their weaker defensive capabilities.

One possible candidate for the most own goals scored in the Premier League is Richard Dunne of Aston Villa, who finished the 2009-10 season with 6 own goals. Dunne played in 36 matches and scored 2 goals, with an own goal percentage of 17.2%. This is the highest own goal percentage among all players who played in at least 30 matches that season. Additionally, Aston Villa finished the season in 19th place, which suggests that they may have had more opportunities to score own goals due to their weaker defensive performance.

Another player who could potentially have scored the most own goals is Thomas Vermaelen of Arsenal, who scored 5 own goals in 34 matches, giving him an own goal percentage of 14.7%. Vermaelen's own goals were crucial in Arsenal's disappointing season, as they finished in 4th place and missed out on a Champions League spot.

It's worth noting that the own goal statistics can be influenced by various factors, such as the team's defensive strategy, the opponents they faced, and the individual players' abilities. Therefore, it's possible that other players may have also scored a significant number of own goals that season, making it difficult to definitively identify the player who scored the most own goals.
r1: The player in the Premier League with the most career goals is Richard Dunne. And there is a tie between players Martin Škrtel and Lewis Dunk for most goals in a single season.
r2: Different players are recognized for the most own goals in the Premier League, some for all-time and career own goals and some for single-season own goals. Irish former footballer Richard Dunne holds the record for most all-time and career Premier League own goals with 10. Slovak footballer Martin Škrtel and English footballer Lewis Dunk hold the record for the most single-season Premier League own goals with four each.

a: The metabolic activity in a cell occurs primarily in the cytoplasm, which is the material within the cell membrane, excluding the nucleus. The cytoplasm is a complex and dynamic environment that contains various organelles, such as mitochondria, ribosomes, and lipid droplets, which are involved in different metabolic pathways. The cytosol, the gel-like substance that fills the cytoplasm, provides a platform for metabolic reactions to occur.

One of the key mechanisms that regulate metabolic activity in the cytoplasm is the bottleneck model, which exploits stochastic processes to increase cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops. This mechanism allows for the selection of cells with the least amount of mutant load, leading to a stabilization or reduction in mutant load between generations. The DNA repair processes in mitochondria, such as base excision repair, double-strand break repair, and direct reversal, also play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial DNA and preventing mutations that could lead to metabolic dysfunction.

The cytosol is also the site of most metabolism in prokaryotes and a large proportion of metabolism in eukaryotes. Major metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, protein biosynthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway occur in the cytosol. The localization of these pathways can differ in other organisms, such as fatty acid synthesis occurring in chloroplasts in plants and apicoplasts in apicomplexa.

In summary, the metabolic activity in a cell occurs primarily in the cytoplasm, where various organelles and cytosolic components work together to maintain the cell's metabolic homeostasis. The bottleneck model and DNA repair processes in mitochondria help to regulate and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial DNA, while the cytosol provides a platform for metabolic reactions to occur.
r1: The overall metabolic activity occurs within the cytoplasm and the metabolic activity oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the Mitochondria. And photophosphorylation occur in the Chloroplast.
r2: There are a number of metabolic activities, which occur in different parts of a cell. The overall metabolic activity and metabolic activity of glycolysis occur within the cytoplasm.

a: The last American prisoner of war (POW) released from Vietnam was Robert R. Garwood, a former United States Marine Corps Private First Class who was captured on September 28, 1965 near Da Nang, Quang Nam Province. Garwood was released in 1973, along with other American POWs, as part of Operation Homecoming, the result of diplomatic negotiations that concluded U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. However, Garwood's case is controversial because he was reportedly held by the North Vietnamese until June 4, 1975, two years after the official end of the war, for propaganda purposes. He was eventually released on March 22, 1979.

According to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, as of the end of the Vietnam War in 1973, approximately 1,350 Americans were still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action, and roughly 1,200 were reported killed in action but whose bodies were not recovered. These missing personnel became the subject of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, and efforts to account for their fates continue to this day.

The case of Robert Garwood highlights the complex and often contentious nature of the POW/MIA issue during the Vietnam War. Garwood's claims of collaboration with the enemy and his subsequent classification as AWOL/Deserter/Collaborator by the Department of Defense (DoD) have been the subject of much debate and controversy. While the DoD has investigated Garwood's claims and found them to have no factual basis, Garwood continues to maintain his innocence and accuses the DoD of trying to rewrite history to downplay his 1984 claims about POWs left behind.

In conclusion, the last American POW released from Vietnam was Robert R. Garwood, who was held for over nine years by the North Vietnamese. However, the POW/MIA issue remains unresolved, with many Americans still unaccounted for and their fates unknown. The case of Robert Garwood highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding this issue, and the ongoing efforts to account for the missing personnel from the Vietnam War.
r1: Following the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973, U.S. prisoners of war were returned during Operation Homecoming during February through April 1973. Often cited as the last verified American POW from the Vietnam War, Robert R. Garwood was taken to North Vietnam in 1969, and reportedly was released in 1973 along with the other U.S. POWs as part of the Paris Peace Accords. The North Vietnam government may have kept him as a POW until June 4, 1975 for propaganda reasons until the war ended. After June 4, 1975 he would have no propaganda value as the United States had ceased fighting in Vietnam. However, he did not return to the United States until March 22, 1979.
r2: The dates the last POW was released from Vietnam differ. It was reported that the last POW had been released from Vietnam in 1973, the year U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that all U.S. servicemen taken prisoner had been accounted for. However, the last POW wasn't released from Vietnam until June 4, 1975, after the propaganda campaign, and wasn't released from Vietnam and able to return to the US until March 22, 1979.

a: According to the 2011 census, the literacy rate of India was 74.04 percent. However, this figure masks significant disparities in literacy rates across different states and gender. While states like Tripura, Kerala, and Mizoram have achieved high literacy rates of 94.65 percent, 93.91 percent, and 91.58 percent respectively, other states like Bihar and UP have much lower literacy rates of 63.82 percent and 72.21 percent respectively. Additionally, there is a significant gender gap in literacy rates, with male literacy rates being higher at 82.14 percent compared to female literacy rates of 65.46 percent.

The reasons for these disparities are complex and multifaceted. One major factor is the lack of access to education, particularly for girls and children from poor families. In areas where there is no discrimination, poor funding and impoverished families means that children often cannot afford textbooks and stationery. When children do get educated, the general lack of economic progress in the state means that government jobs are the only alternative to farming labor, yet these jobs, in practice, require bribes to secure – which poorer families cannot afford. This leads to educated youths working on the farms, much as uneducated ones do, and leads parents to question the investment of sending children to school in the first place.

Another factor is the strong stereotyping of female and male roles, which results in females being pulled out of school to help with agricultural work at home. Fewer than 2% of girls who engaged in agriculture work attended school. This is exacerbated by the fact that the large proportion of illiterate females is another reason for the low literacy rate in India.

Furthermore, absolute poverty in India has also deterred the pursuit of formal education as education is not deemed of as the highest priority among the poor as compared to other basic necessities. The MRP-based (mixed recall period) poverty estimates of about 22% of poverty in 2004–05, which translated to 22 out of per 100 people are not meeting their basic needs, much less than meeting the need for education.

In conclusion, the literacy rate of India is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors such as access to education, gender bias, poverty, and societal expectations. To improve literacy rates, addressing these underlying factors is crucial. The government and other stakeholders must work together to ensure that all children, regardless of gender or socio-economic status, have access to quality education and the opportunity to reach their full potential.
r1: According to the 2011 Census, the combined literacy rate of India was 74.04%. Inequality based on gender differences resulted in female literacy rates being lower at 65.46% than that of their male counterparts at 82.14%. In the 2001 Census, the combined literacy rate of India was 64.83% with the male literacy rate at 75.26% and the female literacy rate at 53.67%.

The show's focus on true crime cases, specifically those involving women who have committed or been accused of committing murder, has captivated audiences and helped the network shift its direction towards true crime programming in 2017.

The show's unique format, which combines narration by Martin with interviews from key individuals involved in the cases, has proven to be highly effective in telling the stories of these high-profile and often bizarre cases. Each episode explores the motivations behind the murders, which can range from revenge against a cheating husband or lover to a large insurance payoff or the end of years of abuse. The show's documentary-style approach and Martin's engaging narration have made "Snapped" a popular choice for true crime fans, leading to its long-running success and the spin-off of two other shows.

Despite the show's success, Martin announced in February 2018 that she would no longer be narrating "Snapped." However, her legacy as the voice of the series will continue to be heard in the numerous episodes she has narrated over the years. Repeats of the show can still be seen on over-the-air broadcast television exclusively on the digital subchannel network Escape. With its long history and dedicated fan base, "Snapped" remains a staple of true crime programming and a testament to the enduring popularity of the genre.

a: Sure! Here's a comprehensive paragraph that answers the question:

Although Hernando de Soto was the first European to officially note the Mississippi River in 1541, it was Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette who were the first to explore the majority of the river's length, traveling from its upper reaches to within 435 miles of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1673, Jolliet and Marquette, along with five other voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry, set out from St. Ignace, Michigan, and followed Lake Michigan and the Fox River to the site of present-day Portage, Wisconsin. There, they portaged their canoes and gear through a marsh and oak forest to the Wisconsin River, establishing the shortest convenient portage between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. From June 17, the expedition traveled down the Mississippi, exploring its length and reaching within 435 miles of the Gulf of Mexico before turning back north at the mouth of the Arkansas River. This expedition not only marked the first European exploration of the Mississippi River but also established the potential for trade and commerce between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basins.
r1: While Hernando de Soto was the first European to make official note of the Mississippi River by discovering its southern entrance in 1541, Jolliet and Marquette were the first to locate its upper reaches, and travel most of its length, about 130 years later. Alonzo Alvarex de Pineda was the first European to sail upriver the Mississippi River.
r2: Alonzo Alvarez de Pineda, a Spanish explorer, became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River in 1519 and the first European to sail it upriver. However, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto is credited as being the first European to discover it, being the first to make official note of the river when he discovered its southern entrance in 1541. Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer, and Jacques Marquette, a French missionary, were the first to locate its upper reaches and travel most of its length about 130 years later.

a: The statement "You don't have to say you love me" has a rich history, with multiple contexts and meanings. The phrase originated as the title of a song by British singer Dusty Springfield, which was released in March 1966 and became her only British number one hit. The song was adapted from the Italian song "Io che non vivo senza te" and featured lyrics co-written by Springfield's manager, Vicki Wickham, and Simon Napier-Bell. The phrase has since been used in various contexts, including as the title of a memoir by author Sherman Alexie, which was published in 2018.

In the context of Alexie's memoir, the phrase takes on a different meaning, as it is used to explore themes of love, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. The memoir was initially awarded the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction, but the award was later rescinded due to accusations of sexual harassment against Alexie. The fallout from these accusations included the renaming of a scholarship in Alexie's name and the deletion or modification of references to him on various websites and blogs.

The phrase "You don't have to say you love me" has also been used in the context of Dusty Springfield's career and legacy. Springfield was a prominent British singer in the 1960s, known for her powerful voice and soulful performances.

a: Tornadoes most commonly occur in the United States in a region known as Tornado Alley, which spans across the central and southern Great Plains, including parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. This region is characterized by a unique combination of warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from Canada, creating an ideal environment for the formation of tornadoes. In addition to the Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas core, other areas with high tornado frequencies include the Upper Midwest, the lower Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, and the lower Mississippi Valley. Some studies suggest that there are also smaller tornado alleys located across the United States.

Despite the elevated frequency of destructive tornadoes in Tornado Alley, building codes in these areas are not necessarily stricter compared to other parts of the country, and are markedly weaker than some hurricane-prone areas such as south Florida. This is a concern, as tornadoes can cause significant damage and loss of life. In fact, the March 1913 tornado outbreak sequence, which affected several states including Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana, resulted in at least 241 deaths and $9.68 million in damages, with the deadliest tornado occurring in Omaha, Nebraska, killing at least 94 people and causing F4 damage.

It is important for residents of Tornado Alley to be aware of the risks of tornadoes and take necessary precautions, such as having a tornado evacuation plan, reinforcing homes with storm shelters or safe rooms, and staying informed about weather conditions through local news and emergency alert systems. Additionally, researchers and meteorologists continue to study tornadoes and their patterns to improve forecasting and warning systems, which can help save lives and reduce damage.
r1: Tornado Alley is a loosely defined area of the central United States where tornadoes are most frequent. The term was first used in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota and Minnesota.Tornado climatologists distinguish peaks in activity in certain areas and storm chasers have long recognized the Great Plains tornado belt. Although the official boundaries of Tornado Alley are not clearly defined, the main alley extends from northern Texas, through Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota and North Dakota. States such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio are sometimes included in Tornado Alley. The geographical region where tornadoes most commonly occur is the Central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains. The state of Alabama is tied for the most reported F5 tornadoes. For the period 1950 to 2006, three hundred and fifty eight people were killed by tornadoes in Alabama, ranking the state third nationwide behind Texas and Mississippi.
r2: Tornadoes are more common in the United States than in any other country or state. Most tornadoes in the United States occur in the Central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains, and while there is no officially defined 'Tornado Alley' at its broadest this area includes areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota. Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio are sometimes included. The state where tornadoes most commonly occur is Texas. Storm Chasers recognize this as the Great Plains Tornado Belt.

a: The phrase "under God" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a Joint Resolution of Congress, amending Section 4 of the Flag Code enacted in 1942. This addition was the result of a campaign led by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization, and was motivated by a desire to distinguish the United States as a nation under God, as opposed to simply a nation under the flag. The idea was first proposed by the Rev. George MacPherson Docherty, the pastor of New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., who argued that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation, and that the addition of "under God" would set the United States apart from other nations. The proposal gained support from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was a recent convert to Presbyterianism, and was signed into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954. The addition of "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance was not without controversy, however, and has been the subject of legal challenges and debates over the years.
r1: Louis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the addition of "under God" to the pledge at a meeting on February 12, 1948. In 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance. In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree Assemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words "under God" after the words "one nation." Rep. Charles Oakman introduced a bill to that effect. Congress passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954 under 4 U.S.C. §4.
r2: The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the flag of the United States.

a: In William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet," Paris belongs to the Capulet family. He is a wealthy young nobleman who is engaged to Juliet, the daughter of the Capulets. Paris is a foil to Romeo, the Montague, who falls in love with Juliet and ultimately dies for her. While Romeo is impulsive and passionate, Paris is more measured and controlled in his affections. He professes his love for Juliet in a formal and proper manner, saying that he will nightly weep for her (Act V, Scene III). However, their love is doomed as their families are sworn enemies. When Romeo kills Paris in a duel, it sets in motion the tragic events that ultimately lead to the deaths of both Romeo and Juliet.

The character of Paris is significant in the play as he represents the societal expectations and pressures placed on Juliet as a young woman. As her fiancé, Paris is seen as a desirable and eligible suitor, and Juliet's parents are eager to have her marry him in order to secure their family's wealth and status. However, Juliet's love for Romeo is not considered appropriate by her family and society, as the Montagues and Capulets are sworn enemies. This conflict between love and duty is a central theme in the play and is exemplified by the character of Paris.

Furthermore, Paris's death serves as a catalyst for the tragic events that unfold in the play. His duel with Romeo leads to Romeo's banishment from Verona, which ultimately leads to Juliet's fake death and her reunion with Romeo in the tomb. The tragic events that follow are a result of the feud between the Capulets and Montagues, and the death of Paris serves as a reminder of the senseless violence and tragedy that can result from such conflicts.

In conclusion, Paris is a significant character in "Romeo and Juliet" as he represents the societal expectations placed on Juliet and serves as a foil to Romeo. His death sets in motion the tragic events that ultimately lead to the deaths of both Romeo and Juliet, highlighting the senseless violence and tragedy that can result from feuds and societal pressures.
r1: Count Paris is a kinsman of Prince Escalus and seeks to marry Juliet. He belongs to the House of Escalus which also includes Prince Escalus, the Prince of Verona, who is the desperate resolver of the feuding families and Mercutio, who is the cousin of Prince Escalus and Count Paris, and is a close friend of Romeo and his cousin Benvolio. He supports and fights on the Montague side of the feud, and just like a Montague, hates the Capulet family.
r2: William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet" contains a relatively distinctive cast of characters. In addition to the play's eponymous protagonists, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, the play contains roles for members of their respective families and households. Prince Escalus, the city's ruler, and his kinsman, Count Paris are both members of the House of Escalus.

a: The term "cupboard love" originates from a popular learning theory of the 1950s and 1960s, rooted in psychoanalysis. According to this theory, attachment develops in infancy as a result of the mother satisfying her infant's instinctual needs, exclusively. The theory suggests that our primary drive in infancy is food, which leads to a secondary drive for attachment. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was the first to propose that attachment is a result of the mother fulfilling her infant's physiological needs, and that this instinctive behavior is rooted in years of evolution.

The theory of cupboard love is based on the idea that, in the early stages of infancy, the mother is the primary caregiver and the infant learns to rely on her for survival. As the infant begins to comprehend that the mother is the source of food and comfort, they form an attachment to her. This attachment is thought to be driven by the infant's primary drive for food, which eventually develops into a secondary drive for attachment.

The theory also suggests that the mother's role in satisfying the infant's needs is crucial in the development of attachment. According to Therese Benedek, who studied symbiosis between the mother and infant, the mother's presence and caregiving provide a sense of security and comfort to the infant, which in turn fosters attachment. Additionally, René Spitz proposed the concept of "eight-month anxiety," which suggests that infants experience anxiety when left alone with strangers, highlighting the importance of the mother's presence in the development of attachment.

In conclusion, the term "cupboard love" originates from a psychoanalytic theory that emphasizes the role of the mother in the development of attachment in infancy. The theory suggests that attachment is driven by the primary drive for food and the secondary drive for attachment, and that the mother's caregiving and presence are crucial in fostering a secure attachment.
r1: Cupboard love is a popular learning theory of the 1950s and 1960s based on the research of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Mary Ainsworth. Rooted in psychoanalysis, the theory speculates that attachment develops in the early stages of infancy.

This is in accordance with the legal principle that a minor cannot enter into a legal contract or provide informed consent for a procedure. However, parents or guardians can provide consent for minors to receive a tattoo, and some tattoo artists may choose to impose additional restrictions based on their own moral beliefs, such as refusing to tattoo clients under a certain age or limiting the type and location of tattoos they will perform. It is important to note that while some tattoo artists may claim their personal restrictions are based on law, this is not always the case and it is important to verify the artist's policies and qualifications before receiving a tattoo. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the tattoo artist is using proper sanitation and hygiene techniques to minimize the risk of infection and other complications.

a: In the 2016 presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won the state of New Hampshire, with a narrow margin of 2,736 votes. However, the town of Hanover, which is known for being a liberal stronghold, provided Clinton with her largest margin of victory in the state. Clinton received 85% of the vote in Hanover, which was more than twice her statewide margin of victory. This suggests that the support from Hanover played a significant role in Clinton's victory in New Hampshire.

The 2016 Republican primary in New Hampshire was characterized as "topsy-turvy" and saw an "all-out assault" on establishment politics. Donald Trump dominated the polls, with Chris Christie, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush vying for second place. However, Kasich ultimately emerged as the leading mainstream alternative to Trump and Cruz, and he received the endorsement of the New Hampshire Union Leader, which historically has been a powerful endorsement in the state. Despite this, Kasich only won a Republican primary in half of the elections from 1980 to 2012, suggesting that the endorsement may not have had as much of an impact as in previous years.

Overall, the 2016 presidential election in New Hampshire was marked by a strong showing for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the town of Hanover, as well as a competitive Republican primary that saw a challenge to the establishment candidates.

a: The history of immigration laws in the United States can be traced back to the late 18th century, when the Constitution granted Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. In 1790, the Naturalization Act was passed, allowing those who had resided in the country for two years and had lived in their current state of residence for a year to apply for citizenship. However, this law only applied to "free white persons" of "good moral character." Over the next few decades, subsequent laws increased the residency requirements and added additional restrictions, such as the Naturalization Act of 1795, which required a three-year notice of intention to apply for citizenship, and the Naturalization Act of 1798, which increased the residency requirement to 14 years. The Naturalization Law of 1802 repealed the Naturalization Act of 1798.

In the late 19th century, the Immigration Act of 1882 was passed, which imposed a head tax on noncitizens who came to American ports and restricted certain classes of people from immigrating to the United States. This act created the first federal immigration bureaucracy and laid the foundation for more regulations on immigration, such as the Immigration Act of 1891. Prior to the passage of the Immigration Act of 1882, the United States Congress had passed two significant acts regarding immigration: the Page Act of 1875, which restricted the immigration of forced laborers coming from Asia, and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which halted all legal immigration of Chinese laborers. These acts were motivated by public fear of the Chinese influence in the labor market and the economy, as well as simple prejudice and the public perception of these immigrants' inability to assimilate into American culture.

Throughout the history of immigration laws in the United States, there has been a pattern of increasing restrictions and regulations, particularly targeting certain nationalities and ethnic groups. The Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1868, protected children born in the United States, regardless of the immigration status of their parents. However, the history of immigration laws in the United States has been marked by discrimination and exclusion, with laws aimed at restricting the immigration of certain groups based on their race, national origin, and perceived inability to assimilate. These laws have had a profound impact on the demographics of the United States and have shaped the country's immigration policies to this day.
r1: Congress passed the first naturalization law in 1790. The Naturalization Act of 1790 enabled those who had resided in the country for two years to apply for citizenship for free white persons of good moral character. The Immigration Act of 1882 was signed on August 3, 1882 by President Chester A. Arthur. The act imposed a 50 cent head tax to fund immigration officials and laid the foundation for more regulations on immigration.
r2: The first US law passed regarding naturalization was the Naturalization Act of 1790, which enabled those who had resided in the country for two years and had kept their current state of residence for a year to apply for citizenship, but restricted it to "free white persons". The first US general immigration law was passed on August 3, 1882. It was called the Immigration Act of 1882 and imposed a head tax on noncitizens of the United States who came to American ports and restricted certain classes of people from immigrating to America.

a: The International Red Cross was established on August 22, 1864, as a direct result of the work of Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman who was moved by the suffering he witnessed on the battlefield after the Battle of Solferino in 1859. Dunant was appalled by the lack of medical care and humanitarian aid for wounded soldiers, and he advocated for the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to provide such aid in the case of war. He also called for the development of international treaties to guarantee the neutrality and protection of wounded soldiers, medical personnel, and field hospitals.

Dunant's experiences in Solferino inspired him to write the book "A Memory of Solferino," which was published in 1862 and sent to leading political and military figures throughout Europe. The book's impact was significant, and it led to the convening of an international conference in Geneva in 1863, which ultimately resulted in the adoption of the first Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. The Convention established legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, field medical personnel, and specific humanitarian institutions in armed conflicts.

The International Red Cross was established as a direct result of this Convention, with the goal of providing humanitarian aid to those affected by war and armed conflict. The organization was founded by Dunant and a group of other committed individuals, including Gustave Moynier, who would go on to become the first President of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The organization's symbol, the Red Cross, was chosen as a symbol of neutrality and humanitarian aid.

Since its establishment, the International Red Cross has grown to become one of the most respected and influential humanitarian organizations in the world, providing aid to those affected by conflict, natural disasters, and other crises. The organization has played a crucial role in promoting international humanitarian law and protecting the rights of those affected by armed conflict, and it has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize three times, including in 1917, 1944, and 1963.

In conclusion, the International Red Cross was established in 1864 as a direct result of the work of Henry Dunant and the impact of his book "A Memory of Solferino." The organization was founded with the goal of providing humanitarian aid to those affected by war and armed conflict, and it has since grown to become one of the most respected and influential humanitarian organizations in the world.
r1: After Henry Dunant witnessed soldiers suffering at the Battle of Solferino, He wrote a book entitled "A Memory of Solferino" that inspired the creation of the International Red Cross. The precursor to the International Red Cross was called the "International Committee for Relief to the Wounded" and was established on October 29, 1863. In 1864, the first national societies were founded in Belgium, Denmark, France, Oldenburg, Prussia, Spain, and Württemberg.
r2: The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an international humanitarian movement with approximately 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide, which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering.

a: "Fairytale of New York" is a timeless Irish folk-style ballad written by Jem Finer and Shane MacGowan, and recorded by their band the Pogues, featuring the soulful vocals of Kirsty MacColl. The song's origins can be traced back to 1985, when it was first begun, but it underwent rewrites and aborted attempts at recording before finally being completed in August 1987.

The song's enduring popularity can be attributed to its powerful storytelling, which explores themes of love, loss, and the struggles of the working class.

The Pogues' use of traditional instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, and accordion adds a distinctly Irish flavor to the song, while MacColl's soaring vocals bring a sense of emotional depth and vulnerability to the narrative.

The song's lyrics, which tell the story of two lovers struggling to make ends meet in New York City during the holiday season, are both poignant and relatable. The male character, sung by MacGowan, speaks of his struggles to find work and provide for his partner, while the female character, sung by MacColl, longs for a better life and a chance to escape their difficult circumstances. The song's chorus, with its haunting harmonies and soaring melody, captures the sense of longing and desperation that is at the heart of the narrative.

a: The first North American Indigenous Games (NAIG) was held in Hobbema, Alberta, Canada in 1990. The vision behind the NAIG was to improve the quality of life for Indigenous Peoples by providing a platform for self-determined sports and cultural activities that promote equal access to participation in the social, cultural, and spiritual fabric of the community. The games were founded by three individuals, including Willie Littlechild of the Ermineskin First Nation, Big John Fletcher of the Peigan First Nation, and Charles Wood, who served as the chairperson in 1990. The NAIG was established in response to concerns about the well-being of young Indigenous people and the lack of opportunities for them to engage in constructive activities that celebrated their cultural heritage. The first games brought together Indigenous athletes from across North America to compete in a variety of sports, including basketball, soccer, and volleyball, and to participate in cultural events and ceremonies that honored their traditions. The NAIG has since become a biennial event, with subsequent games held in various locations across Canada and the United States.

a: Sure! Here's the comprehensive answer to the question "Who has the most blocks in the NBA?" with the given factoid context:

Of all players in the NBA, Anthony Davis currently holds the record for the most blocks in a single season, with 285 blocks in the 2014-2015 season. However, this record is not the only notable achievement in the realm of blocks in the NBA. Other players, such as Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Dwight Howard, have also demonstrated exceptional blocking ability, with Shaq and Hakeem each recording three seasons with over 200 blocks. Additionally, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder have both had impressive block totals in recent years, with Durant recording 162 blocks in the 2012-2013 season and Westbrook recording 174 blocks in the 2013-2014 season.

The player efficiency rating (PER) is a useful tool for evaluating individual player performance, and it takes into account several different statistics, including blocks. The current top 10 players in terms of PER are LeBron James, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, and Dwight Howard, all of whom have consistently high efficiency ratings and are known for their well-rounded skill sets.

In terms of blocks specifically, the EuroLeague and EuroCup use a different formula to determine player efficiency, called the performance index rating (PIR). This formula takes into account several different statistics, including blocks, and is used to evaluate player performance in European competitions.

Overall, the NBA has a rich history of high-blocking players, and players like Anthony Davis, Shaquille O'Neal, and Hakeem Olajuwon have set the bar high for future generations of big men. With the continued emphasis on athleticism and defensive skill in the modern NBA, it's likely that we'll see many more players make their mark on the blocks leaderboards in the years to come.

a: In the Atlanta Exposition Speech, Booker T. Washington addresses both African American individuals and Southern white leaders, with the intention of laying the foundation for the Atlanta compromise. He appeals to both groups to work together towards a more harmonious and prosperous future, with a focus on education and economic empowerment. Washington acknowledges the long history of racial tension and discrimination in the South, but urges African Americans to leave behind the bitterness of the past and embrace the present moment as an opportunity for progress. He encourages them to join the world of work and to seek out opportunities in commerce and industry, rather than relying on the immigrant population. At the same time, he appeals to Southern white leaders to recognize the value of their African American fellow citizens and to provide them with basic education and due process of law. By doing so, Washington aims to establish a new paradigm for race relations in the South, one that emphasizes cooperation and mutual benefit over conflict and oppression. The Atlanta Exposition Speech is a seminal moment in American history, marking a shift towards a more pragmatic and inclusive approach to race relations that would have far-reaching consequences for the nation's future.
r1: The Atlanta Exposition Speech was presented before a predominantly white audience at the Cotton States and International Exposition (the site of today's Piedmont Park) in Atlanta, Georgia, and has been recognized as one of the most important and influential speeches in American history. He told the white audience that rather than relying on the immigrant population arriving at the rate of a million people a year, they should hire some of the nation's eight million blacks.
r2: In the words of his Atlanta Exposition speech in the Atlanta Exposition, Washington was addressing the white audience and the blacks. The audience Washington was directly addressing in person was a predominantly white audience at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia.

a: The latest version of Ubuntu is Ubuntu 16.04.5, which was released on August 2, 2018. This version does not support the AMD Catalyst (fglrx) driver for AMD/ATI graphics cards and instead recommends the free software radeon and amdgpu alternatives, although these may not provide optimal graphics performance. The first point release, 16.04.1, was released on July 21, 2016, and subsequent point releases 16.04.2, 16.04.3, and 16.04.4 were released on February 17, 2017, August 3, 2017, and March 1, 2018, respectively. The latest point release, 16.04.5, provides the latest Linux kernel, 4.13, from Ubuntu 17.10.

Ubuntu 16.04.5 also includes other changes and improvements, such as the default DNS resolver now being "systemd-resolved", support for printers that allow printing without printer-specific drivers, and Linux kernel 4.10. Additionally, Ubuntu 17.04, released on April 13, 2017, dropped support for the 32-bit PowerPC architecture, following the same move by the upstream Debian project.

It is worth noting that Ubuntu 16.04.5 is the last version of Ubuntu to feature the Unity 7 desktop by default, as the distribution will switch to GNOME for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS next year. This means that Ubuntu 17.04, which features a maintenance version of Unity 7, is potentially the last version of the distribution to come with this desktop environment by default.

a: The British Prime Minister during the Quit India Movement was Winston Churchill, who served from 1940 to 1945. The Viceroy of India during this time was Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, who served from 1936 to 1943. The Quit India Movement was a mass protest launched by the Indian National Congress in 1942, demanding an end to British rule in India. The movement was met with heavy-handed suppression by the British, who arrested tens of thousands of leaders and imprisoned them until 1945. Despite the failure of the movement to achieve immediate independence, the British government realized that India was ungovernable in the long run due to the cost of World War II. The question of how to exit gracefully and peacefully became a postwar concern.

The background to the Quit India Movement can be traced back to 1939, when Indian nationalists were angry that British Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, had brought India into the war without consultation with them. The Muslim League supported the war, but the Congress Party was divided. In 1942, the Congress Party passed a resolution conditionally supporting the fight against fascism, but was rebuffed when it asked for independence in return. This led to the outbreak of the Quit India Movement, which was launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 8, 1942, with a call to "Do or Die."

The Quit India Movement was effectively crushed by the British, who refused to grant immediate independence. However, the movement had a lasting impact on the British government's policy towards India. In 1992, the Reserve Bank of India issued a 1 rupee commemorative coin to mark the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India Movement.

Linlithgow, as the Viceroy of India during this time, played a significant role in the British government's policy towards India. He was a British Unionist politician and colonial administrator who served as Governor-General and Viceroy of India from 1936 to 1943. He was born into a noble family and was educated at Eton College. In 1912, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and his proposers included prominent figures such as William Turner and Alexander Crum Brown. Linlithgow was known for his strong support for the British Empire and his opposition to Indian independence. He was a key figure in the British government's decision to bring India into the war without consulting Indian leaders, and his policies during the Quit India Movement were widely criticized by Indian nationalists. Despite this, he remained a prominent figure in British politics and was later appointed as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
r1: Victor Alexander John Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow served as Governor-General and Viceroy of India from 1936 to 1943. He was usually referred to simply as Linlithgow. In 1939, Indian nationalists were angry that British Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, had brought India into the war without consultation with them. The only outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands. The Quit India campaign was effectively crushed.
r2: During the Quit India Movement, launched on August 8, 1942, Winston Churchill was the British prime minister, and Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, was the British Viceroy and Governor-general of India. Churchill served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945, while Hope served as Governor-general and Viceroy of India from 1936 to 1943.

Despite the introduction of the patroon system in 1628 to attract settlers, the colony grew slowly. In 1664, the English took control of the city, renaming it "New York" after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city has since grown to become the largest city in the United States, with a diverse population of immigrants and a thriving economy, tracing its origins back to its humble beginnings as a Dutch trading post over 390 years ago.

a: The Ottoman Empire took over Greece in the 15th century, after a series of military campaigns and treaties that gradually reduced the Byzantine Empire's control over the region. The Ottomans first gained control of the northern parts of Greece in the 14th century, and by the beginning of the 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was limited to the city of Thessaloniki and the Peloponnese. The Ottomans besieged and captured Constantinople in 1453, and then advanced southwards into Greece, capturing Athens in 1458. The Greeks held out in the Peloponnese until 1460, but by the early 16th century, all of mainland Greece and most of the Aegean islands were under Ottoman control. The Venetians and Genoese retained control over some port cities, such as Nafplio, Monemvasia, Parga, and Methone, but these were eventually lost to the Ottomans as well. The mountains of Greece remained a refuge for Greeks who desired to flee Ottoman rule and engage in guerrilla warfare. The Cyclades islands were officially annexed by the Ottomans in 1579, and Cyprus fell to the Ottomans in 1571. The Venetians retained control over Crete until 1669. The Ionian Islands were never ruled by the Ottomans, and remained under the rule of the Republic of Venice. The Ottoman conquest of Greece had a significant impact on the region's culture and society, as many Byzantine Greek scholars fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and contributing to the Renaissance. Overall, the Ottoman Empire's takeover of Greece was a gradual process that spanned several centuries, marked by military campaigns, treaties, and the flight of many Byzantine Greeks to the West.
r1: After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Ottoman Empire took over all of mainland Greece except for the Despotate of the Morea. However, it later fell to the Ottomans in 1460. The Ottoman empire also captured Athens, Greece in 1458. The Ottoman Empire completed their takeover of Greece excluding the Ionian Islands in 1670.
r2: Different parts of Greece were taken by the Ottoman Empire at different times, with some being untaken by the Ottomans. In 1453, the Ottoman Empire took over all of mainland Greece except for the Despotate of the Morea, which fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the takeover of mainland Greece. In 1458, the Ottomans took over Athens, the capital and largest city of Greece. In 1670, the Ottoman Empire completed its takeover of Greece except for the Ionian Islands, the only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped Ottoman rule, which remained Venetian until 1797.

a: The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), a member of the Sternorrhyncha suborder and native to East Asia, was accidentally introduced to North America from Japan and has since become a destructive pest in eastern North America. The insect feeds on the sap of hemlock and spruce trees, primarily attacking eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana), and has caused significant damage to these species. In its native range, HWA is managed by natural predators and parasitoids, as well as host resistance, but in eastern North America, it has been able to establish itself and spread rapidly, with 90% of the geographic range of eastern hemlock being affected as of 2015. The insect was first found in the eastern United States near Richmond, Virginia in 1951 and has since spread to northern Georgia to coastal Maine and southwestern Nova Scotia. Despite its origins in East Asia, HWA has been present in western North America for thousands of years, where it primarily attacks western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and has caused only minor damage due to natural predators and host resistance.
r1: The hemlock woolly adelgid is an insect of the order Hemiptera native to East Asia. It feeds by sucking sap from hemlock and spruce trees. They were accidentally introduced to North America from Japan. They were first found in the eastern United States near Richmond, Virginia, in 1951.

a: The question of who has won the most Super Bowl games is a complex one, with several teams having achieved the feat of winning multiple championships. The Pittsburgh Steelers hold the record for the most Super Bowl championship titles, with six wins. However, the New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl appearances, with ten. Tom Brady, the Patriots' quarterback, has an impressive record of five Super Bowl rings, the most won by any single player.

Despite their success, several teams have failed to achieve a "three-peat," or win three consecutive Super Bowls. The Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, and Denver Broncos all failed to return to the title game in the third season after their previous wins. The Buffalo Bills, on the other hand, went to four consecutive Super Bowls from 1990-1993, a feat unmatched in NFL history, but lost in every appearance.

The history of the Super Bowl can be traced back to the early years of the NFL, when the Packers won three consecutive championships from 1929-1931 without playing any postseason games. The Packers then won the NFL championship in 1965, followed by their first two Super Bowl victories in 1966 and 1967.

In recent years, the Patriots have continued to dominate the Super Bowl, with Tom Brady leading the team to six Super Bowl appearances and five victories. Brady has been named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week three times this season, and his 187 career wins are the most in NFL history.

Overall, the Super Bowl is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world, with the seven most-watched broadcasts in U.S. television history being Super Bowls. The game has become an unofficial American national holiday, with Super Bowl Sunday being the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption after Thanksgiving Day.

a: During the reign of Augustus, the Roman Empire reached its peak in terms of population, territorial expansion, and geographical cataloguing. The Empire's vast size and resources were made possible by the extensive deforestation of entire mountains, as described by Plato in his book "Critias." This deforestation allowed for the expansion of agriculture and urbanization, which in turn led to a significant increase in population. The Empire's population was estimated to be between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population, making it the largest unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century. The meticulous keeping of written records and geographical cataloguing were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration, as evident in the "Geography" of Strabo and the commemorative account of Augustus' achievements in the "Res Gestae." The Empire's largest expanse was reached under Trajan, encompassing an area of 5 million square kilometers. The extensive territorial expansion and population growth were made possible by the efficient administration and record-keeping of the Roman Empire.
r1: The Roman Empire at its peak had an estimated population of 56,800,00 or 55–60 million. The estimate accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population and made it the largest population of any unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century. Some have argued that the population of the roman empire at its peak according to recent demographic studies was between 70 million to more than 100 million.

a: In the film version of "The Sound of Music," the von Trapp family escapes to the nearby abbey after their final performance at the Salzburg Festival, where they are hiding in the cemetery crypt. The family is discovered by Rolfe, but he hesitates to raise the alarm, allowing them to flee using the caretaker's car. The Brownshirts pursue them, but the nuns have removed parts of the engine, preventing them from being caught. The family then makes their way on foot across the border into Switzerland, where they find safety and freedom.

This escape route was not present in the original memoir by Maria von Trapp, which was based on her own experiences as a governess to the von Trapp children. In the memoir, the family escaped over the mountains to Switzerland on foot after the "Anschluss," or annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. This change was made by the screenwriters, Alan Jay Lindsay and Sidney Crouse, to make the story more dramatic and to fit the conventions of a Hollywood film.

The decision to alter the escape route was likely influenced by the desire to create a more suspenseful and action-packed plot, as well as to emphasize the themes of freedom and escape that are central to the story. By having the family escape over the mountains, the filmmakers were able to create a more physically demanding and emotionally intense journey for the characters, which would be more engaging for audiences. Additionally, the change allowed the film to focus more on the personal relationships between the characters, particularly between Maria and the Captain, and between Maria and the children, which is a key aspect of the story.

Overall, the change in the escape route was a deliberate choice made by the screenwriters to create a more compelling and emotionally resonant film, while still staying true to the core themes and events of the original story.
r1: In the Sound of Music, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where the nuns hide them in the cemetery crypt. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the Swiss Alps into Switzerland.
r2: The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical drama film produced and directed by Robert Wise, and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.

In February 2013, the House of Bishops decided to allow eight senior women clergy to participate in all meetings of the house until there were six women bishops sitting as of right. The House of Bishops also expressed its commitment to publishing new ways forward to enable women to become bishops. In July 2013, the synod decided to reintroduce legislation to be addressed in November, and in November 2013, the General Synod approved a package of measures as the next steps to enable women to become bishops. The package of proposals included a disputes resolution procedure and a House of Bishops declaration, and was welcomed by the synod with five guiding principles already agreed by the House of Bishops. The draft legislation was sent to all dioceses of the Church of England for approval, and after achieving the required two-thirds majority in all three houses of General Synod in July 2014, the legislation was passed, allowing for the ordination of female bishops in the Church of England. This marked a significant milestone in the history of the Church, recognizing the ministry of women in all aspects of church life and furthering the goal of gender equality within the institution.

He is the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons, and his longevity is a testament to his incredible work ethic and dedication to the game. During his time with the Lakers, Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, and was named to the All-NBA Team 15 times. He also led the league in scoring for two seasons and ranks third on the all-time regular season scoring list and fourth on the all-time postseason scoring list. Bryant's impressive career statistics and accolades are a reflection of his exceptional talent, but they also speak to his remarkable durability and endurance, as he played in 1,529 games over the course of his career, the most in NBA history. His commitment to the Lakers and his refusal to play for any other team made him a beloved figure in Los Angeles and cemented his place as one of the greatest players in NBA history.
r1: Some notable NBA players who hold records for playing the longest in the NBA include Vince Carter, who is the player with the most NBA seasons in the NBA, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who is the player with the most career minutes in the NBA and Robert Parish who is the player with the most games in the NBA.

a: According to studies between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of babies born at 24 weeks of gestation that survive is between 50 to 70 percent. This is a significant increase compared to babies born at 23 weeks, where the survival rate is between 20 to 35 percent. The survival rate for babies born at 24 to 25 weeks is higher due to the fact that these babies are more developed and have a higher birth weight, which increases their chances of survival. Additionally, the survival rate for babies born at 26 to 27 weeks is even higher, with more than 90 percent of babies surviving.

It is worth noting that the survival rate for babies born at 24 weeks is influenced by their birth weight. Babies weighing less than 500 grams (17.6 ounces) have a much lower survival rate, and it is rare for them to survive. However, the survival rate for these babies increases 3-4% per day between 23 and 24 weeks of gestation, and about 2-3% per day between 24 and 26 weeks. This means that the longer a baby is in the womb, the higher their chances of survival.

The period of viability is a critical factor in determining the legal rights of a fetus. Traditionally, the period of viability is considered to be after the 28th week of gestation, but more recently, it has been defined as starting at 24 weeks. This is because babies born at this gestational age are capable of living outside the womb, and their survival rate is significantly higher than those born earlier. The legal implications of viability are important, as they determine the rights of the fetus to protection and medical interventions.
r1: A 2012 study found that 40-70% of babies survived while being born at 24 weeks, whereas studies between 2003 and 2005 found that 20 to 35 percent of babies born at 24 weeks of gestation survive.
r2: Fetal viability or foetal viability is the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus. There is no sharp limit of development, gestational age, or weight at which a human fetus automatically becomes viable. According to studies between 2003 and 2005, 20 to 35 percent of babies born at 24 weeks of gestation survive. A 2012 study suggests that 40-70% of babies born at 24 weeks of gestation survive.

The Northern Isles' unique history and cultural heritage have been recognized by their inclusion on the UK's "Tentative List" of World Heritage Sites, with the collective site "The Crucible of Iron Age Shetland" featuring Broch of Mousa, Old Scatness, and Jarlshof.
r1: The culture that built the brochs is unknown, but by the late Iron Age the Northern Isles were part of the Pictish kingdom. Both Orkney and Shetland were part of the Kingdom of Norway until they were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century. They remained part of it until the 1707 formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the 1801 formation of the United Kingdom.
r2: Several kingdoms have claimed ownership of the northern islands of Scotland, a pair of archipelagos off the north coast of mainland Scotland known as the Northern Isles, including the Pictish kingdom and Norway. Prior to 875, the Pictish people, or Picts, a group of Celtic-speaking peoples who lived in what is now northern and eastern Scotland, claimed ownership of the Northern Isles. In 875, the Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre annexed the Northern Isles.

a: The size of the Supreme Court is not specified in the United States Constitution, and instead, it is determined by Congress through legislation. Over time, the number of justices has been adjusted to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits, with the court currently consisting of nine justices. The process of appointing Supreme Court justices is a collaborative effort between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as well as the bar association, in Israel. In the United Kingdom, the Supreme Court is composed of the President and Deputy President, and ten other Justices, all with the style of "Justices of the Supreme Court." The size and composition of the Supreme Court can have significant implications for the country's legal system and the interpretation of its laws, and as such, it is an important aspect of the judicial branch of government.

The fact that the size of the Supreme Court is not specified in the Constitution has led to some interesting historical developments. For example, in 1801, an act was passed that would have reduced the size of the court to five members, but this was negated by an 1802 act before any vacancies occurred. Additionally, in 1866, an act was passed that provided that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced, thinning the bench to seven justices by attrition. These examples illustrate the flexibility and adaptability of the Supreme Court, and the ability of Congress to shape the court's composition and size over time.

The process of appointing Supreme Court justices is also an important aspect of the judicial system. In the United States, the President nominates candidates for the Supreme Court, and the Senate must approve them by a majority vote. In Israel, the President of the Supreme Court and other judicial officials play a significant role in the appointment process, and the Judicial Selection Committee, which is composed of representatives from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, as well as the bar association, must approve the appointments. In the United Kingdom, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council retains jurisdiction over certain matters, and the Supreme Court is composed of the President and Deputy President, and ten other Justices, all with the style of "Justices of the Supreme Court."

The size and composition of the Supreme Court can have significant implications for the country's legal system and the interpretation of its laws. For example, the Court's rulings on issues such as federal preemption, civil procedure, abortion, same-sex marriage, and the Bill of Rights have had a profound impact on the legal landscape of the United States. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Israel has ruled on numerous sensitive issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the rights of Arab citizens, and discrimination between Jewish groups in Israel. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, on the other hand, has a more limited jurisdiction, but its judicial functions are still an important aspect of the country's legal system.

In conclusion, the size and composition of the Supreme Court is an important aspect of the judicial branch of government, and it has significant implications for the country's legal system and the interpretation of its laws. The process of appointing Supreme Court justices is a collaborative effort between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as well as the bar association, and it is an important aspect of the judicial system. The size and composition of the Supreme Court can be influenced by historical events and the political climate, and it is an important aspect of the country's legal landscape.
r1: In the United States, Congress determines the size of the US Supreme Court which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789. In the United Kingdom, The court is composed of the President and Deputy President and ten other Justices of the Supreme Court, all with the style of "Justices of the Supreme Court" under section 23(6) of the Constitutional Reform Act. In Israel, Supreme Court Judges are appointed by the President of Israel, from names submitted by the Judicial Selection Committee, which is composed of nine members: three Supreme Court Judges (including the President of the Supreme Court), two cabinet ministers (one of them being the Minister of Justice), two Knesset members, and two representatives of the Israel Bar Association.
r2: Several countries have Supreme Courts. The size of the United States Supreme Court is determined by Congress. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is composed of the President and Deputy President and ten other Justices of the Supreme Court, all with the style of "Justices of the Supreme Court" under section 23(6) of the Constitutional Reform Act. In Israel, the number of Supreme Court Judges is determined by a resolution of the Knesset, the unicameral legislature of Israel.

a: The song "A Horse with No Name" was written by Dewey Bunnell and recorded by the folk rock band America, which was released in late 1971 in Europe and early 1972 in the United States. The song was the band's first and most successful single, topping the charts in several countries and being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song was inspired by the hot, dry desert depicted in a Salvador Dalí painting and the strange horse that had ridden out of an M.C. Escher picture. The writer, Dewey Bunnell, was also influenced by his childhood travels through the Arizona and New Mexico desert when his family lived at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The song was originally called "Desert Song" and was intended to capture the feel of the desert and the horse that had ridden out of an M.C. Escher picture. The song was recorded at the home studio of musician Arthur Brown, near Puddletown, Dorset, and was intended to be popular in both the United States and Europe. The band's label, Warner Brothers, was reluctant to release the ballad "I Need You" as the first single from the album, but ultimately "A Horse with No Name" was chosen as the lead single and became a huge success.

a: The last Olympic men's hockey gold medal was won by Russia in the 2018 Winter Olympics held in PyeongChang, South Korea. This was Russia's first Olympic gold medal since the breakup of the Soviet Union and their first back-to-back gold medal since the start of NHL participation in 1998. The team was led by stars such as Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk, who were allowed to compete under the Olympic flag after passing anti-doping tests, despite a doping scandal in Russia. In the final, Russia defeated Germany 4-3 in overtime, with Kirill Kaprizov scoring the winning goal. The Russian team sang the banned anthem during the medal ceremony, but the IOC did not pursue any action. Canada won the bronze medal over the Czech Republic 6-4.

The Olympic men's hockey tournament has a rich history, dating back to 1920, and has been dominated by teams from the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union/Russia. The tournament has undergone changes over the years, including the introduction of professional athletes in 1988 and the use of larger international-sized ice rinks in 2014. The 2018 tournament was notable for the absence of NHL players, who were not released by their teams to participate. This led to a weaker field of competitors, but still produced some exciting games and surprises, such as Slovenia's upset of Slovakia and Latvia's narrow defeat of Canada.

Teemu Selänne, a Finnish player, was named tournament MVP and set several records, including oldest Olympic goal-scorer and oldest Olympic ice hockey medal winner. Canada's victory marked their ninth Olympic gold medal and their first back-to-back gold medal since the start of NHL participation.

a: The question of who was crucified on an X-shaped cross is a complex one, with multiple accounts and traditions surrounding the martyrdom of Andrew the Apostle and Eulalia of Barcelona. According to early texts such as the Acts of Andrew, Andrew was bound, not nailed, to a Latin cross, but a tradition developed that he was crucified on a cross of the form called "crux decussata" or Saint Andrew's Cross, supposedly at his own request as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus. In contrast, Eulalia of Barcelona was subjected to thirteen tortures for refusing to recant her Christianity, and her martyrdom is commemorated with statues and street names throughout Barcelona. While there are some similarities between the stories of Eulalia and Eulalia of Mérida, such as the appearance of a dove following their decapitation, it is unclear whether they are the same person. Overall, the question of who was crucified on an X-shaped cross is a matter of historical debate and interpretation, with multiple accounts and traditions surrounding the martyrdom of these two saints.
r1: Andrew the Apostle also known as Saint Andrew was crucified on a cross of the form called crux decussata, now commonly known as a "Saint Andrew's Cross" — supposedly at his own request, as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus had been. Saint Eulalia, co-patron saint of Barcelona, was a 13-year-old Roman Christian virgin who was martyred in Barcelona during the persecution of Christians in the reign of emperor Diocletian.

a: The Little Albert study on conditioned fear was conducted by John B. Watson and his graduate student Rosalie Rayner at Johns Hopkins University. The study, which was published in the February 1920 issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology, provided empirical evidence of classical conditioning in humans and demonstrated the concept of stimulus generalization. The study aimed to condition a phobia in an emotionally stable child, and for this purpose, the researchers chose a nine-month-old infant named Albert. Before the experiment, Albert was given a battery of baseline emotional tests to measure his natural fear responses to various stimuli, such as a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, and other objects.

Watson and Rayner followed the procedures used by Ivan Pavlov in his experiments with dogs, pairing a neutral stimulus (a white rat) with an unconditioned stimulus (a loud noise) to elicit a fear response from Albert. Over time, Albert learned to associate the rat with the noise and began to exhibit a fear response to the rat alone, demonstrating classical conditioning. The study also showed that Albert's fear response generalized to other furry objects, such as a rabbit and a monkey, demonstrating stimulus generalization.

The significance of the Little Albert study lies in its demonstration of the power of classical conditioning to shape human behavior and emotional responses. The study has been widely cited and has had a lasting impact on the field of psychology, influencing the development of behavioral therapy and the understanding of phobias and other anxiety disorders. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the ethical implications of research involving human subjects, particularly in the use of children as participants.

Rosalie Rayner, Watson's graduate student and collaborator, played a significant role in the study's success. She was responsible for conducting the baseline tests and assisting Watson in the experiment itself. Rayner's contributions to the study were not limited to her technical skills, however. As a woman in a male-dominated field, she faced significant challenges and obstacles, including discrimination and skepticism from some of her male colleagues. Nevertheless, she persevered and made significant contributions to the field of psychology, both during her time working with Watson and in her independent research career.

r2: The Little Albert experiment was a controlled experiment showing empirical evidence of classical conditioning in humans. The study also provides an example of stimulus generalization. It was carried out by John B. Watson and his graduate student, Rosalie Rayner, at Johns Hopkins University. After observing children in the field, Watson hypothesized that the fearful response of children to loud noises is an innate unconditioned response. He wanted to test the notion that by following the principles of the procedure now known as "classical conditioning", he could use this unconditioned response to condition a child to fear a distinctive stimulus that normally would not be feared by a child (in this case, furry objects). The experiment today would be considered unethical according to the American Psychological Association's ethic code.

a: The first hydrogen fuel cell was created in the mid-19th century, with two pioneers in the field, William Robert Grove and Christian Friedrich Schönbein, independently developing early versions of the technology. Grove, a Welsh physicist and barrister, is credited with the discovery of sputtering and the development of the first crude fuel cell in 1838. He used a combination of sheet iron, copper, and porcelain plates, and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid to generate current from hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in water. Schönbein, a German physicist, also developed a crude fuel cell in 1838, which he discussed in a letter to the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science.

The development of the first hydrogen fuel cell was a significant milestone in the history of energy production, as it marked the beginning of a new era of clean and efficient energy sources. However, it would take several decades for the technology to mature and become commercially viable. In the 1930s, British engineer Francis Thomas Bacon successfully developed a 5 kW stationary fuel cell, and in the 1950s, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist working for General Electric, further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte.

Today, the fuel cell market is growing rapidly, with Pike Research estimating that the stationary fuel cell market will reach 50 GW by 2020. The technology has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the 19th century, and it is now being used in a variety of applications, including power generation, transportation, and stationary power. The first hydrogen fuel cell, developed by Grove and Schönbein, laid the foundation for the development of this clean and efficient technology, and their work continues to inspire innovation in the field of energy production.
r1: The first references to hydrogen fuel cells appeared in 1838. In a letter dated October 1838 but published in the December 1838 edition of The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, Welsh physicist and barrister Sir William Grove wrote about the development of his first crude fuel cells. Grove later sketched his design, in 1842, in the same journal. The fuel cell he made used similar materials to today's phosphoric acid fuel cell.

a: The tradition of considering Sunday as the seventh day of the week can be traced back to the early Christian church, where it was observed as the day of the week on which Jesus rose from the dead and the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles. By the second century, some Christians had begun to observe only Sunday and not the traditional Jewish Sabbath, which was observed on the seventh day of the week. This shift was likely influenced by pagan and political factors, as well as the centrality of the Eucharist in early Christian worship. The International Standard ISO 8601, which was first published in 1988, also recognizes Sunday as the seventh and last day of the week. Additionally, in some languages, such as Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian, Sunday is considered the first day of the week, further emphasizing its status as the seventh day. Overall, while the Sabbath day was originally observed on the seventh day of the week, the shift to Sunday as the seventh day can be traced back to the early Christian church and has been reinforced by international standards and linguistic traditions.

a: The first magnetic compasses were used by Chinese ships during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), a period of significant technological advancements and maritime exploration in ancient China. According to historical records, the compass was first invented by a Chinese astronomer and mathematician named Shen Kuo (1031-1095 CE) during the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 CE). However, it was not until the Han Dynasty that the compass became a standard navigational tool for Chinese ships.

The use of the compass by Chinese ships revolutionized maritime navigation, enabling sailors to determine direction and navigate with greater accuracy, even in cloudy or foggy weather conditions. This technological innovation played a crucial role in facilitating the extensive maritime trade and exploration that characterized the Han Dynasty, as Chinese ships were able to venture further out into the Pacific Ocean and establish trade routes with neighboring countries.

The magnetic compass was made from a piece of lodestone, a naturally magnetized iron ore, which was placed on a cork or wood float in a bowl of water. The needle of the compass was balanced on a pivotal point, allowing it to rotate freely and indicate the direction of magnetic north. The compass was used in conjunction with astronomical observations and other navigational techniques to determine the ship's position and course.

The widespread adoption of the magnetic compass by Chinese ships during the Han Dynasty marked the beginning of a new era in maritime navigation and had a profound impact on the development of global trade and cultural exchange. It is a testament to the ingenuity and scientific achievements of ancient Chinese civilization, which continued to influence navigation and exploration for centuries to come.
r1: The first magnetic compasses used by Chinese ships for maritime navigation were used from 1111-1117. They were also used for navigational orienteering from 1040-1044.
r2: The magnetic compass is the most familiar compass type. It functions as a pointer to "magnetic north", the local magnetic meridian, because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass was used in Song Dynasty China by the military for navigational orienteering by 1040-1044, and was used for maritime navigation by 1111-1117.

a: Where do Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet?

Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet at the Straits of Mackinac, a series of narrow waterways located in the U.S. state of Michigan between the Lower and Upper Peninsulas. The Straits of Mackinac connect the two lakes, which are hydrologically considered one lake, known as Lake Michigan-Huron. The combined waters of the two lakes flow through the Straits, which are about 20 fathoms (120 feet or 37 meters) deep, and are joined by a wide, open-water channel. The Straits of Mackinac are a major shipping lane, providing passage for raw materials and finished goods, and connecting the iron mines of Minnesota to the steel mills of Gary, Indiana. The Straits are also a significant geological feature, with currents that are "whipsawed" in a unique way, and islands such as Bois Blanc and Mackinac, and one uninhabited island, Round Island, forming the edge of the Straits.

The connection between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan is not a fixed one, as the water levels in the two lakes are in near-equilibrium, and the flow of water through the Straits is generally eastward, but can also move in either direction depending on local conditions. This hydrological connection between the two lakes has been present for thousands of years, and has been shaped by the advances and retreats of the Laurentian ice sheet during the last ice age, which repeatedly opened and dammed various possible outlets from the area, and provided dramatically varying amounts of meltwater to the system.

In summary, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet at the Straits of Mackinac, a series of narrow waterways that connect the two lakes and allow for the exchange of water between them. The Straits are a significant geological and hydrological feature, and have been shaped by the advances and retreats of the Laurentian ice sheet during the last ice age.
r1: Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are lakes in Michigan that are joined through the open-water Straits of Mackinaw, also known as the Mackinac Strait.

Netball was first included in the Commonwealth Games program at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This was a significant milestone for the sport, as it marked the first time netball was featured as a medal event in the Games, which had previously been dominated by more traditional sports like athletics and swimming. The inclusion of netball was a result of the Commonwealth Games Federation's efforts to promote gender equality and increase participation from female athletes.

a: The phrase "the pen is mightier than the sword" has a rich history, with numerous predecessors expressing the idea that communication and written language are more effective tools than direct violence. The phrase was first coined by English author Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1839 for his play "Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy," and it quickly gained currency as a commonplace by the 1840s. The idea can be traced back to Assyrian sage Ahiqar, who lived in the early 7th century BC and is credited with coining the first known version of the phrase, "The word is mightier than the sword." This idea was later echoed by Greek playwright Euripides, who died in 406 BC and is believed to have written, "The tongue is mightier than the blade."

The power of the pen is mightier than the sword because it has the ability to inspire, persuade, and educate others, whereas violence often leads to destruction and suffering. Written language has the power to transcend time and space, allowing ideas to be shared and disseminated to a wide audience, whereas physical violence is limited by its geographical and temporal constraints. Moreover, written language allows for the preservation of history and the recording of knowledge, ensuring that the wisdom of the past can be passed down to future generations.

In the context of the Library of Congress's Thomas Jefferson Building, the adage "the pen is mightier than the sword" is particularly fitting, as it highlights the importance of written language and communication in shaping society and promoting progress. The building's decoration with this phrase serves as a reminder of the power of the written word and the importance of preserving and promoting knowledge.

Overall, the phrase "the pen is mightier than the sword" is a timeless reminder of the power of written language and communication to shape society and promote progress, and it continues to inspire and motivate individuals to this day.
r1: Assyrian sage Ahiqar coined the first known version of this phrase which was "The word is mightier than the sword." The phrase "The pen is mightier than the sword" was created by English author Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1839 for his play Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy.
r2: Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton, PC was an English writer and politician. He coined famous phrases like "the great unwashed", "pursuit of the almighty dollar", "the pen is mightier than the sword", "dweller on the threshold", and the opening phrase "It was a dark and stormy night." Assyrian sage Ahiqar, who reputedly lived during the early 7th century BCE, coined the first known version of this phrase, "The word is mightier than the sword".

a: In the Marvel Cinematic Universe film "Guardians of the Galaxy" (2014), the voice of Rocket Raccoon is provided by actor Bradley Cooper, while in the Telltale video game series of the same name, the voice of Rocket is provided by Nolan North. This difference in voice actors is likely due to the fact that the film and the game have different casting directors and production teams, and the game's storyline is an exclusive, original narrative rather than a direct adaptation of the film.

The film's director, James Gunn, has stated that he wanted to create a "colorful science-fiction world" with elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, and science fiction artist Chris Foss helped design the look of the spacecrafts in the film. Gunn also cited the "Mass Effect" video game series, "Farscape", "Star Wars", and Flash Gordon as inspirations for the film. Principal photography began in July 2013 in London, and the film's cast, including Bradley Cooper as Rocket, was announced at San Diego Comic-Con International later that month.

In contrast, the Telltale game series is based on the Marvel Comic series and the recent film, but with an exclusive storyline. The game's cast includes Scott Porter as Star-Lord, Emily O'Brien as Gamora, Nolan North as Rocket Raccoon, Brandon Paul Eells as Drax the Destroyer, and Adam Harrington as Groot. The game's first episode was released in April 2017, and it features a different set of voice actors from the film, including Trevor Devall as Rocket Raccoon.

a: The eighth series of Britain's Got Talent, which aired in 2014, was a memorable season for several reasons. Firstly, it marked the first time that the show held auditions in Northern Ireland instead of Scotland, providing a new pool of talent for the judges to discover. Additionally, the series saw the introduction of the "Golden Buzzer" format, which allowed each judge to select one act per episode to send directly to the live finals. This format was a first for the show and added an exciting new element to the competition.

However, the series was also notable for a more somber reason - the absence of judge Simon Cowell, who was forced to miss several days of auditions due to illness. His fellow judges, Ant & Dec, stepped in to fill his absence and kept the show running smoothly. Despite these changes, the series still managed to average around 9.8 million viewers per episode, a testament to the enduring popularity of the show.

In the end, it was boy band Collabro who emerged as the winners of the series, with opera singer Lucy Kay finishing in second place and singing/rapping duo Bars and Melody in third. Collabro, consisting of Michael Auger, Jamie Lambert, Matthew Pagan, and Thomas J. Redgrave, won over the hearts of the judges and the audience with their powerful vocal performances and infectious energy.

Since their victory, Collabro has gone on to achieve great success, releasing three albums and performing at prestigious venues such as the Royal Albert Hall. They have also gained a dedicated fan base, whom they refer to as their "Collaborators." The group's journey from unknown talents to national sensations is a testament to the power of Britain's Got Talent in discovering and showcasing exceptional talent.

a: The Ottoman Empire took over Palestine in the late 15th century, following the Mamluk-Ottoman Wars. In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottomans in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans ultimately conquered Palestine after their victory over the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. The Ottoman conquest of Palestine was relatively swift, with small battles fought against the Mamluks in the Jordan Valley and at Khan Yunis en route to the Mamluk capital in Egypt. There were also minor uprisings in Gaza, Ramla, and Safad, which were quickly suppressed. The Ottomans maintained the administrative and political organization that the Mamluks left in Palestine.

Under Ottoman rule, Palestine experienced a period of relative stability and prosperity, with the region being celebrated by Arab and Muslim writers of the time as the "blessed land of the prophets and Islam's revered leaders." Muslim sanctuaries were "rediscovered" and received many pilgrims, and the region was a center of Islamic learning and culture. In 1496, Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi wrote his history of Palestine known as "The Glorious History of Jerusalem and Hebron."

However, the Ottoman rule over Palestine was not without its challenges. In the 19th century, the Ottomans faced internal strife and external threats, including the Egyptian-Ottoman conflict that led to the brief Egyptian rule over Palestine from 1831 to 1840. The so-called Peasants' Revolt by Palestine's Arabs was precipitated by heavy demands for conscripts, and the local leaders and urban notables were unhappy about the loss of traditional privileges, while the peasants were well aware that conscription was little more than a death sentence.

Overall, the Ottoman Empire's takeover of Palestine in the late 15th century marked the beginning of a new era in the region's history, with the Ottomans maintaining control over the region for over 400 years until the early 20th century. During this time, Palestine experienced significant cultural, religious, and political developments, but also faced challenges and conflicts that would shape the region's future.
r1: The Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine for the first time in 1516 and again in 1840.
r2: The Ottoman Empire was a state that controlled much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Turks in a battle for control over western Asia. The Ottomans proceeded to conquer Palestine following their 1516 victory over the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. The Ottoman Empire took over Palestine for a second time in 1840.

a: The most common type of rock in Earth's crust is mafic rock, which is characterized by its high content of magnesium and iron. Mafic rocks are dark in color and include minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. These rocks are typically dense and have a higher density than felsic rocks, which are lighter in color and rich in silicon, aluminum, and potassium. The lower silica content in mafic magma results in lower viscosity, making mafic lava less explosively violent than felsic lava. Additionally, the presence of calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar in mafic rocks distinguishes them from felsic rocks, which are typically rich in quartz and feldspar. Overall, the distinction between mafic and felsic rocks is based on their chemical composition and mineralogy, with mafic rocks being enriched in iron, magnesium, and calcium, and felsic rocks being enriched in silicon, aluminum, and potassium.
r1: The most common type of rock in earth's oceanic crust are Mafic rocks which include basalt, diabase, and gabbro, whereas the most common type of rock in earth's continential crust are felsic rocks which include granite.

a: The laws that directed the flow of goods between England and its colonies were known as the Navigation Acts, a series of English laws that developed, promoted, and regulated English ships, shipping, trade, and commerce between other countries and with its own colonies. The Navigation Acts were first enacted in 1651 under the Commonwealth and were reenacted and broadened with the restoration by the Act of 1660. These laws regulated England's fisheries and restricted foreigners' participation in its colonial trade. The Acts generally prohibited the use of foreign ships, required the employment of English and colonial mariners for three quarters of the crews, including East India Company ships, and prohibited the colonies from exporting specific products to countries and colonies other than those British. The laws also mandated that imports be sourced only through Britain.

The Navigation Acts were based on earlier precedents, such as the charters granted to the London and Plymouth Company and the various royal patents bestowed by Charles I and Charles II. These early companies held the monopoly on trade with their plantations, and the Crown's purpose was to restrict to England the future commerce with America. The Acts were designed to promote English shipping and commerce, and to encourage the development of the colonies.

The Navigation Acts were significant in the historical development of England's commercial and colonial programs. They laid the foundation for the commercial palladium of Britain, as noted by Adam Anderson. The Acts also had a profound impact on the colonies, as they restricted the colonies' ability to trade with other countries and forced them to rely on England for trade. This led to resistance from the colonies, and the Acts were a major factor in the lead up to the American Revolution.

Overall, the Navigation Acts were a key component of England's colonial policy, designed to promote English commerce and shipping, restrict foreign competition, and regulate the flow of goods between England and its colonies. The Acts had far-reaching consequences for the development of the colonies and the eventual course of American history.
r1: The Navigation Acts, or more broadly the Acts of Trade and Navigation, was a long series of English laws that developed, promoted, and regulated English ships, shipping, trade, and commerce between other countries and with its own colonies. More narrower acts that directed the flow of goods include An Order in Council of 24 October 1621 which prohibited the Virginia colony to export tobacco and other commodities to foreign countries, and The Ordinance for Free Trade with the plantations in New England, which was passed in November 1644.
r2: The Acts of Trade and Navigation, specifically the Navigation Acts directed the flow of goods between England and the colonies. The Order in Council of 24 October 1621 banned Virginia from exporting goods to other countries. And, The Ordinance for Free Trade with the plantations in New England, directed the flow of goods between England and the New England colonies.

a: A systolic blood pressure (BP) value represents the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels at the peak of the cardiac cycle, when the ventricles are contracting. This occurs near the end of one heartbeat and is typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) along with diastolic pressure, which is the minimum pressure in the arteries at the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood. Normal resting adult blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mmHg, with a systolic pressure of 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mmHg. However, blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the day and in response to various factors such as stress, nutrition, drugs, disease, exercise, and even momentary changes like standing up. Hypertension is defined as abnormally high arterial pressure, while hypotension is abnormally low arterial pressure. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is important for diagnosing and monitoring various cardiovascular conditions, and there are several methods available, including non-invasive methods such as mercury-tube sphygmomanometers and semi-automated or automated devices.
r1: For each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure is peak pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the end of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are contracting and is considered the maximum during one heartbeat. Diastolic pressure is minimum pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood, and is the minimum pressure between two heartbeats.
r2: Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. Most of this pressure is due to work done by the heart by pumping blood through the circulatory system. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heartbeats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure. For each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure is peak pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the end of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are contracting.

a: Based on the given factoids, the player with the most 3-pointers in a season is Stephen Curry, who made 402 three-pointers in the 2015-2016 season while playing for the Golden State Warriors. This is a record that has yet to be broken in the NBA. Curry's impressive shooting ability and success from beyond the arc have revolutionized the game of basketball, inspiring teams to incorporate the three-pointer as a key part of their strategy.

Diana Taurasi, a forward for the Phoenix Mercury and UMMC Ekaterinburg, holds the record for the most 3-pointers made in a WNBA season, with 123 made in the 2006 season. Taurasi's impressive shooting ability and clutch performances have earned her the nickname "White Mamba," and she is widely regarded as one of the greatest women's basketball players of all time.

Both Curry and Taurasi have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to make shots from beyond the arc, and their success has helped to elevate the three-pointer as a crucial aspect of the game. Their records for most 3-pointers in a season are a testament to their skill and dedication to their craft, and they continue to inspire and influence the next generation of basketball players.
r1: A three-point field goal, also 3-pointer, is a field goal in a basketball game made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc surrounding the basket. In a NBA season, Stephen Curry, an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors, has made the most 3-pointers. In a NCAA men's basketball season, Stephen Curry also has made the most 3-pointers. In a WNBA season, Diana Taurasi, an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Mercury, has made the most 3-pointers.

a: The story of Jonah and James Bartley share a common theme of being swallowed by a large sea creature, but their experiences and outcomes are vastly different. Jonah, according to the biblical account, was called by God to warn the people of Nineveh of impending destruction, but he fled on a ship instead and was cast overboard during a storm. He was then swallowed by a giant fish, where he spent three days before being vomited up onto the shore. In contrast, James Bartley was a real-life individual who was reportedly swallowed by a sperm whale during a whaling expedition. He survived the ordeal and was found alive inside the whale's stomach, but the story of his survival is considered to be a myth or a hoax.

The story of James Bartley has many parallels with the story of Jonah, as both men were swallowed by large sea creatures and survived against all odds. However, the outcome of their experiences was vastly different. Jonah's experience in the belly of the fish was a transformative one, as he learned to obey God's commands and was ultimately spat out onto the shore to fulfill his purpose. In contrast, James Bartley's experience in the whale's stomach was not transformative, and he was simply rescued and lived out the rest of his life.

The story of Jonah has been interpreted in many ways throughout history, but one of the most significant interpretations is as a symbol of the power of repentance and forgiveness. Jonah's reluctance to obey God's commands and his subsequent time in the fish's belly serve as a metaphor for the consequences of disobedience and the power of God's mercy. The story of James Bartley, on the other hand, has no such deeper meaning or symbolism, and is simply a fascinating and unlikely tale of survival.

In conclusion, while the stories of Jonah and James Bartley share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their outcomes and meanings. The story of Jonah has been a powerful symbol of repentance and forgiveness for centuries, while the story of James Bartley is a more recent and somewhat questionable tale of survival.
r1: There are several stories of people being stuck in the belly of a whale. Jonah, a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE, got caught in a storm whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. James Bartley was the central figure in a late nineteenth-century story according to which he was swallowed whole by a sperm whale. In the film Mind Game, Yan, Nishi, Myon and old man got stuck in the belly of whale. In Pinocchio, Geppetto had ventured out to sea to save Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, but was swallowed by a terrible giant whale named Monstro.

a: India conducted its first nuclear test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974, codenamed "Smiling Buddha" or "Pokhran-I." This test was a significant milestone in India's nuclear program and marked the country's entry into the nuclear club of nations. The test was conducted at the Pokhran Test Range in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, and it was overseen by a team of scientists led by Dr. Raja Ramanna and Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The test was a success, and it confirmed India's capabilities in developing nuclear weapons.

The decision to conduct the test was taken by the Indian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had authorized the development of a nuclear program after India's independence from British colonial rule in 1947. The program was headed by Homi Jehangir Bhabha, the founder of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, who had laid the foundation for India's nuclear program. The test was carried out by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key scientists, including Raja Ramanna, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and P.K. Iyengar.

The Pokhran-I test was significant not only for India but also for the global nuclear landscape. It was the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and it marked a turning point in the history of nuclear proliferation. The test was conducted with a high explosive implosion system developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) based on the American design from World War II.

Twenty-four years after Pokhran-I, in 1998, India conducted five further nuclear tests at the same location, codenamed "Pokhran-II." These tests included a thermonuclear device, which marked India's entry into the league of nations with thermonuclear capabilities. Since then, India has declared a moratorium on nuclear testing.

In conclusion, the Pokhran nuclear test of 1974 was a significant milestone in India's nuclear program and marked the country's emergence as a nuclear-capable nation. The test was the result of years of dedication and hard work by a team of scientists led by Dr. Raja Ramanna and Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and it paved the way for India's future nuclear development.
r1: Pokhran is a village and a municipality located in the Jaisalmer district of the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is a remote location in the Thar Desert region and served as the test site for India's first underground nuclear weapon, ballistic missiles. The Ministry of External Affairs designated the test "Pokhran-I", but it is also known as "Smiling Buddha". It was India's first successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974. On 11 and 13 May 1998, twenty-four years after Pokhran-I, the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) conducted five further nuclear tests, dubbed "Pokhran-II", at the Pokhran range.

a: Sure! Here's the comprehensive answer to the question "Who fought with an angel in the Bible?" with the provided factoid context:

In the biblical account of Jacob wrestling with the angel, found in Genesis 32:22-32 and referenced in Hosea 12:4, we see an intriguing episode where Jacob, who later became known as Israel, engaged in a fierce wrestling match with a divine being, often referred to as an angel. The encounter took place on a riverside during Jacob's journey back to Canaan, and it lasted until daybreak. Despite the physical and spiritual intensity of the wrestling match, the being refused to reveal his name, while Jacob was given the new name "Israel" and blessed. The significance of this event is underscored by the fact that Jacob named the place where they wrestled "Penuel," which means "face of God" or "facing God."

The fact that the being with whom Jacob wrestled is referred to as both "man" and "angel" in different parts of the biblical text highlights the complex and enigmatic nature of this divine encounter. Some scholars suggest that the being may have been a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus Christ, while others view it as a theophany, or a manifestation of God's presence. Regardless of the exact nature of the being, the episode is widely seen as a pivotal moment in Jacob's spiritual journey, marking his transformation from a cunning and manipulative trickster to a humbled and blessed servant of God.

The name "Israel" itself holds great significance, as it is derived from the Hebrew word "sarita," meaning "he struggled with God" or "he contended with the divine." This etymology underscores the idea that Jacob's wrestling match with the divine being was not just a physical struggle, but also a spiritual one, as he grappled with his own limitations and the nature of God's presence in his life. In this sense, Jacob's encounter with the angel serves as a powerful metaphor for the spiritual struggles and transformations that we all face in our own lives.
r1: Jacob wrestling with the angel is described in Genesis 32:22–32 and also referenced in Hosea 12:3–5. The "angel" in question is referred to as "man" and "God" in Genesis, while Hosea references an "angel". The account includes the renaming of Jacob as Israel.
r2: Genesis is the first book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. In Genesis, Jacob spends a night wrestling with an angel who is also referred to as a man and God. The next morning, Jacob is given the name Israel and is blessed.

a: When did morning TV start in the UK?

Morning television in the UK can be traced back to the launch of TV-am in 1983, with its flagship program, "Good Morning Britain." However, the BBC had already launched its own morning program, "Breakfast Time," two weeks earlier on January 17, 1983. TV-am struggled initially due to a format that was considered stodgy and formal compared to the more relaxed magazine style of the BBC's "Breakfast Time" and a reliance on advertising income from a timeslot when people were not accustomed to watching television. Despite these challenges, "Good Morning Britain" eventually flourished, only to lose its licence in 1993 to GMTV. In 2010, ITV plc acquired a 25% stake in GMTV, gaining full control of the station, and eventually replaced "GMTV" with "Daybreak" and "Lorraine" in 2010. However, "Daybreak" was cancelled in 2014 due to low ratings, and "Good Morning Britain" was launched in its place.

The breakfast television slot is generally defined as 6:00 to 9:00 am, although two of the three major networks have begun morning news programs at 5:00 am since 2010. Morning television typically includes a news bulletin and a light news/talk show, often featuring advertorials. The daytime television slot adjoins the morning slot and features imported daytime programs from the US, as well as three of the four US soaps that air in the country.

"Good Morning Britain" was TV-am's flagship breakfast television show, broadcast on weekdays from February 1983 until the franchise ended in 1992. The show had a successful run, with a mixture of news and current affairs, weather, cartoons, music, and many popular guests. It also featured a popular exercise section, hosted by Michael Van Straten and Jackie Genova, and later by "Mad Lizzie" Webb. The news was provided in-house by TV-am, but following its loss of the licence, the news provision was contracted out to Sky News.

In summary, morning TV started in the UK with the launch of TV-am's "Good Morning Britain" in 1983, followed by the BBC's "Breakfast Time" two weeks earlier. The breakfast television slot has since been a competitive space with various programs and formats, including "Daybreak" and "Lorraine" in recent years.
r1: Breakfast television in Europe and Australia or morning show in North America is a type of news or infotainment television program that broadcasts live in the morning. In the UK, breakfast TV usually starts at 6 am. After a nine-week trial-run in 1977 on the regional television stations Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television, the Independent Broadcasting Authority considered breakfast television so important that it created an entire franchise for the genre. This franchise was awarded to TV-am, a breakfast-television station and allowed the BBC to launch its own morning program, "Breakfast Time" on 17 January 1983. TV-am, with "Good Morning Britain" as its flagship program, launched just two weeks later on 1 February 1983 and lasted until the franchise ended in 1992. "Good Morning Britain" started on 28 April 2014, and it was A program of the same name aired as part of TV-am between 1983 and 1992 each weekday morning.
r2: Morning TV is typically scheduled between 6 am and 11 am. Yorkshire Television launched a nine-week breakfast television experiment in 1977 that is credited with being the United Kingdom's first breakfast television show, six years before the launch of BBC's Breakfast Time on 17 January 1983, and TV-am on 1 February 1983. Good Morning Britain began airing on 28 April 2014 on ITV.

a: Of the animal mentioned, pigs are the carrier of H1N1. This is based on the fact that swine influenza, which is caused by the H1N1 virus, has been reported numerous times as a zoonosis in humans, with limited distribution but the potential for widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine populations can cause significant economic losses in the industry, and the 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs. While the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive, some evidence suggests that pigs may have caught the disease from humans, and not the other way around. Additionally, swine influenza virus (SIV) is common throughout pig populations worldwide, and transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not uncommon, leading to zoonotic swine flu infections. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. Furthermore, the 2009 outbreak of swine flu in humans was caused by a strain that was a mixture of three types of strains, and six of the genes were found to be very similar to the H1N2 influenza virus that was found in pigs around 2000. In contrast, avian influenza, which is caused by viruses adapted to birds, is not as likely to be transmitted to humans and is not as commonly associated with zoonotic infections.
r1: The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs. Swine influenza, any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs, was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918, after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people. origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive. Avian influenza, known informally as avian flu or bird flu, is a variety of influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds. Some strains of H1N1 are endemic in birds.
r2: In virology, influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A/H1N1) is a subtype of Influenza A virus. Well known outbreaks of H1N1 strains in humans include the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the 1977 Russian flu pandemic as well as the 1918 flu pandemic. The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of H1N1 in humans, birds, animals, and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive.

a: The McMartin preschool trial and the Annie Larsen affair are two notable examples of the longest and most expensive trials in American history. The McMartin preschool trial, prosecuted by the Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner, was a daycare sexual abuse case that lasted from 1984 to 1990 and involved numerous acts of sexual abuse alleged to have been committed by members of the McMartin family who operated a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California. Despite six years of criminal trials, no convictions were obtained, and all charges were dropped in 1990. The trial was part of the day-care sex-abuse hysteria of the 1980s and early 1990s, and it remains the longest and most expensive criminal trial in American history.

In contrast, the Annie Larsen affair was a gun-running plot involving India's Ghadar Party, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and the German Foreign Office during World War I. The plot was the prime offense cited in the 1917 Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial, which was described at the time as the longest and most expensive trial in American legal history. The German effort was headed by Max von Oppenheim, who convinced Har Dayal of the feasibility of the project and established contact with the Ghadar party in the United States. The trial was part of the larger so-called "Hindu–German Conspiracy", and it was a significant example of the involvement of Indian and Irish nationalists in the war effort.

Both trials are notable for their length and expense, but they also highlight the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved. The McMartin trial, for example, was a high-profile case that captured the attention of the media and the public, and it raised questions about the reliability of child witnesses and the nature of sexual abuse. The Annie Larsen affair, on the other hand, highlighted the involvement of foreign powers in domestic politics and the risks of espionage and sabotage during times of war. Overall, both trials demonstrate the importance of thorough investigation and due process in ensuring justice and protecting the rights of all parties involved.

a: Based on the provided factoids, the average age to get married in South Africa is around 28-29 years old for men and 26-27 years old for women. This is based on the data provided in the first factoid, which states that the mean age for first marriage has increased from 28.7 to 29.8 for men and from 26.2 to 27.5 for women over the last 10 years. It is worth noting that these ages are based on the population of South Africa as a whole, and may vary depending on the specific region or demographic.

It is also worth noting that the factoids provide additional information about the population of the Western Cape province, which is one of the nine provinces of South Africa. According to the factoids, 49% of the population of the Western Cape describe themselves as "Coloured", while 33% describe themselves as "Black African", 17% as "White", and 1% as "Indian or Asian". Additionally, Afrikaans is the plurality language spoken in the province, with 50% of the population speaking it as their first language, followed by IsiXhosa (25%), English (20%), and other languages (16%). The province has a diverse age distribution, with 25.1% of the population under the age of 15, 18.3% from 15 to 24, 32.7% from 25 to 44, 18.0% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age of the province is 28 years.

Overall, the factoids provide a comprehensive overview of the demographics and marriage trends in South Africa, including the average age to get married, the distribution of the population by race and language, and the age structure of the province.
r1: The average age overall to get married in South Africa is 30.5 years old. The average age for men to get married is 32 years old, and the average age for women to get married in 29 years old.
r2: In South Africa, the average age to get married is 30.5 years old (29 years old for women and 32 years old for men). Because the age distribution of people at first marriage is skewed with a longer tail towards older ages, the majority of people marry before the average age of first marriage. The median age is a more precise representation of when the majority of people marry; for most reporting sources, however, only the average age at marriage is reported.

a: The first Toyota Land Cruiser was produced in 1951, as a response to the Japanese military's request for a light truck that could be used for military purposes. The Toyota Land Cruiser was developed by reverse-engineering a Bantam GP, and the first prototype, the AK10, was produced in 1942. However, due to the limited use of the AK10 in the military, the Land Cruiser as we know it today was not developed until after World War II. In 1951, Toyota produced 90 units of the first generation Land Cruiser, which was a Jeep-like vehicle. The Land Cruiser has since undergone several transformations and has been produced in various body styles, including convertible, hardtop, station wagon, and cab chassis.

The Land Cruiser's reliability and longevity have been key factors in its popularity, particularly in Australia, where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive vehicle. Toyota extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outback, which is considered one of the toughest operating environments in terms of temperature and terrain. The Land Cruiser has also been popular in other markets, including Japan, where it is exclusive to Toyota dealerships, and in many other countries around the world. However, some countries, such as Canada, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, North Korea, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Syria, and large parts of Europe, do not have access to the Land Cruiser.

Over the years, the Land Cruiser has undergone several transformations and has been produced in various generations, with the latest generation, the Land Cruiser 200, being available in most markets. However, some countries, such as Canada, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, North Korea, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Syria, and large parts of Europe, do not have access to the Land Cruiser. The Land Cruiser's popularity and longevity can be attributed to its ruggedness, reliability, and versatility, as well as its ability to withstand harsh environments and conditions.
r1: The Toyota Land Cruiser is a series of four-wheel drive vehicles produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. It is Toyota's longest running series of models and the second longest-running SUV in production behind the Chevrolet Suburban. When the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the Philippines in 1941, they found an American Jeep and promptly sent it to Japan. The Japanese military authorities ordered Toyota to produce a similar vehicle but to alter the appearance. The resulting Model AK prototype led to the Yon-Shiki Kogata Kamotsu-Sha. The Toyota "Jeep" BJ prototype that became the Toyota Land Cruiser was developed in January 1951.
r2: Production of the first generation of the Land Cruiser began in 1951, while the first prototype of what would become a Toyota Land Cruiser was made in 1941, and the Toyota "Jeep" BJ prototype, which became the Toyota Land Cruiser, was made in January 1951.

a: In the popular Scottish sitcom "Still Game," the character of Winston Ingram is a key figure in the show's humor and plot. According to the provided factoids, Winston is a resident of Finport, a seaside town that was filmed on location in Largs and Saltcoats, North Ayrshire. The show's creators used a variety of locations in these towns to film scenes, including the famous Nardini's ice-cream building and the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry to Millport.

Winston's presence in the show is significant because he is one of the few characters who is not originally from Glasgow, and his Finport residence provides a contrast to the urban setting of the rest of the show. Additionally, Winston's character is often portrayed as being somewhat out of place in the bustling city, adding to the show's comedic effect.

The fact that Winston was originally played by Gavin Mitchell in the stage play version of "Still Game" but was later replaced by Paul Riley for the television series highlights the show's evolution from a stage play to a television show. The show's creators were able to expand on the characters and add new elements to the story, such as the character of Boabby, who was introduced in the television series.

Overall, Winston's presence in "Still Game" adds depth and humor to the show, and his Finport residence provides a unique and interesting setting for the show's events. The show's use of real-life locations in Largs and Saltcoats adds an extra layer of authenticity to the show, making it a beloved and iconic part of Scottish culture.
r1: Still Game was a Scottish sitcom series, following the lives of a group of pensioners who live in Craiglang, a fictional area of Glasgow. The show was first aired on BBC One Scotland on 6 September 2002. The main characters are Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade, two lifelong friends who are neighbours in Osprey Heights, a block of flats. They like to visit their local pub together where their friends Winston Ingram, Tam Mullen and Eric often hang about.

In the episode All the Best, Winston moves to Finport, a seaside town.
r2: In Series 5 of the TV series Still Game, Winston moves to Finport, which was filmed on location in Largs and Saltcoats, North Ayrshire, and the place Winston moved to in the series was a seaside town.

a: In the 2017 live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, the role of Belle is played by Emma Watson, who was the first choice of Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn due to her previous experience as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter franchise. Watson was announced as the lead in January 2015, and the rest of the principal cast, including Luke Evans as Gaston, Dan Stevens as the Beast, Josh Gad as LeFou, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Audra McDonald as Madame de Garderobe, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, Ewan McGregor as Lumière, and Stanley Tucci as Cadenza, were announced between March and April. The casting of Watson as Belle was met with praise from Susan Egan, who originated the role on Broadway, and Paige O'Hara, who voiced Belle in the original animated film and its sequels.

In contrast, the 1946 French romantic fantasy film adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Jean Cocteau, starred Josette Day as Belle and Jean Marais as the Beast. The film is considered a classic of French cinema and features a unique interpretation of the story, with Belle's father being sentenced to death for picking a rose from the Beast's garden and Belle eventually becoming drawn to the Beast despite his physical appearance.

The 1987 American/Israeli musical film adaptation, part of the Cannon Movie Tales series, starred Bette Davis as the voice of Beauty and Philip Casnoff as the Beast. The film was filmed entirely in Israel and featured a contemporary take on the classic tale, with Beauty as a young woman who takes care of her family and must navigate her feelings for the Beast after her father loses their wealth in a storm at sea.

Overall, the role of Belle in the 2017 live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast was played by Emma Watson, who was chosen for the role due to her previous experience as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter franchise.

a: The nonpartisan blanket primary system, also known as the top-two primary, allows all candidates for the same elected office to run against each other regardless of their political party affiliation. This system is designed to promote moderation and bipartisanship by encouraging candidates to appeal to voters from both parties. In the 15th district of California, this system led to a situation where a Tea Party candidate and a former Democratic official advanced to the general election, despite being from different parties. Critics of the system argue that it can lead to vote-splitting within a dominant party, allowing a candidate from the other party to win with less than 50% of the vote. However, proponents argue that the system can lead to more moderate candidates being elected, as they must appeal to a broader range of voters to win. The system is used in several states, including Washington, where it has been in place since 2004.
r1: A nonpartisan blanket primary is a primary election in which all candidates for the same elected office, regardless of political party, run against each other at once, instead of being segregated by political party. It is also known as a jungle primary or qualifying primary.

a: The player who scored the maximum number of goals in a single World Cup match is Ernst Wilimowski, who scored four goals for Poland in a single game in 1938. This record has not been surpassed since then. Only three other players have scored more than 10 goals in World Cup history: Pelé with 12 goals for Brazil, Jürgen Klinsmann with 11 goals for Germany, and Just Fontaine with 13 goals for France. These four players are the only ones to have scored, on average, at least two goals per game played in World Cup history.

The 1954 FIFA World Cup saw the setting of several all-time records, including the most goals scored in a single tournament by a player, with Kocsis of Hungary scoring 11 goals, which was later broken by Fontaine's 13 goals in 1958. The Hungarian team also set the record for the biggest margin of victory in World Cup history with a 9-0 win against Korea. Additionally, West Germany became the first team to win the World Cup after losing a match at the finals, a feat that has been repeated by three other teams since then.

The Switzerland national football team has had some notable performances at the World Cup, including hosting the tournament in 1954 and reaching the quarter-finals three times, but has not won any major titles. They have, however, set several records, including the highest scoring World Cup match, which they played against Austria in 1954, and the record for the most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, which they set at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

a: The Washington Redskins have a rich history in the NFL, with their most notable achievement being their Super Bowl victory in 1988. That season, the team, led by quarterback Doug Williams, became the first black quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory, and Williams was also awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. The team's dominant performance in the game, which they won 42-10, was also notable for being the largest come-from-behind victory in Super Bowl history. However, the Redskins' success that season was not limited to the Super Bowl, as they also had a prolific wide receiver trio nicknamed "The Posse" and a stingy defense that allowed only 224 total points, the second-best total in the NFL that year.

The Redskins' 1991 season was also notable for their impressive start, with 11 straight victories to begin the year. This dominance was fueled by the team's strong offense, which scored 485 points that season, the most of any team in the NFL. The team's defense was also a major factor in their success, allowing only nine sacks, the third-lowest total in NFL history. The Redskins' success that season was not limited to their offense and defense, however, as they also had a strong special teams unit that did not allow a single point to opponents in three of the 16 games played that year.

Despite their success on the field, the Redskins have also had their share of challenges and controversies. In 1987, the team was involved in a players' strike that led to the use of replacement players, who were instrumental in the team's success that season. The team's success that year was also the basis for the 2000 movie "The Replacements." Additionally, the team has been embroiled in controversy over their name and logo, which some argue are offensive and racist.

In recent years, the Redskins have had some success, making the playoffs in 2012 and 2015, but they have also struggled with injuries and inconsistent play. Despite these challenges, the team remains one of the most popular and successful franchises in the NFL, with a dedicated fan base and a rich history of success on the field.

a: France stopped having kings and queens in 1870, when the Second French Empire was established after the Franco-Prussian War. Prior to this, the French monarchy had existed since 843, with the Alpin dynasty, and had unified with England in 1606. The majority of Scottish kings were buried in Isle of Iona, Dunfermline Abbey, and Holyrood Abbey. The historical Serbian monarchy existed as a grand principality, kingdom, and empire before being transformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918. The County of France existed from 1072 until 1130, and the Kingdom of France from 1130 until 1816. The monarchy was interrupted by the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 and the French Revolution of 1848, which established the Second French Republic. The Second French Empire was established in 1852 by Napoleon III, who ruled until his defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and exile in 1870. Since then, there have been various monarchist movements in France, including the Legitimists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists, but the monarchy has not been restored.
r1: The monarchs of the Kingdom of France ruled from the establishment of the Kingdom of the West Franks in 843 until the fall of the Second French Empire on 4 September 1870, with several interruptions.

The song was written and composed by Adam Schlesinger, bassist for the bands Fountains of Wayne and Ivy, and was released on the film's soundtrack. The track was a genuine hit for The Wonders, peaking at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #24 on the Top 40 Mainstream charts. The song was also nominated for a 1996 Golden Globe Award and a 1996 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Mike Viola of The Candy Butchers provided the lead vocals for The Wonders in the film.

In the film, the title song is referenced with "All My Only Dreams" as the B-side, and the actual 45 RPM single released to record stores in North America features "Dance With Me Tonight" as its B-side. The song has since been recorded by The Knack and Bubblegum Lemonade. The Wonders are also seen playing the song "Little Wild One," which was written by the band Gigolo Aunts as a "faux-Beatles"-style tune at the request of their record label.

To convincingly perform The Wonders' songs on-camera, Scott, Schaech, Zahn, and Embry took several weeks of individual lessons followed by daily practice as a group. On April 25, 2017, three quarters of the actors who played The Wonders performed the song live during a surprise appearance at the Roxy in Los Angeles as part of the "Goddamn Comedy Jam" series.

a: Who plays Walter Denton on "Our Miss Brooks"?

The character of Walter Denton on "Our Miss Brooks" is played by Richard Crenna. Crenna first played the role on the radio version of the show in 1948, and continued with the character when the show transitioned to television in 1952. He remained with the show until 1956, when the format of the series was changed and the character of Walter Denton was dropped. Crenna then joined the cast of the comedy series "The Real McCoys" as Luke McCoy, and later became one of the four directors of the series during its six-year run.

It's interesting to note that Crenna was not the first choice for the role of Walter Denton. According to Harry Ackerman, the West Coast director of programming for CBS at the time, the network had initially wanted Shirley Booth for the part, but she was not interested in playing a high school teacher. Lucille Ball was also considered for the role, but she was already committed to "My Favorite Husband" and did not audition. Ultimately, it was Crenna who landed the role, and his portrayal of Walter Denton helped to make "Our Miss Brooks" a hit on both radio and television.

a: "Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus" is a powerful and enduring American Christian hymn, written by George Duffield, Jr. in 1858. The hymn was born out of the dying words of Dudley Atkins Tyng, a Presbyterian minister who was a strong advocate for evangelicalism and opposed slavery. Tyng's words, "Tell my brethren of the ministry, wherever you meet them, to stand up for Jesus," inspired Duffield to write the hymn as a tribute to Tyng's memory and his unwavering commitment to the faith. The hymn was first presented at a memorial service for Tyng, where Duffield preached a sermon based on Ephesians 6:14, "Stand firm, wearing the whole armour of God."

The hymn quickly gained popularity and was sung by both Union and Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, as well as by British revivalists and in public schools in England. However, the hymn's militaristic imagery and language have been criticized for being offensive and exclusive, leading some to object to its use in modern hymnals. Despite these criticisms, "Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus" remains a beloved and enduring hymn, with several melodies written for it, including the one most commonly used today, composed by George James Webb in 1837.

The story behind the hymn's creation and its enduring popularity highlight the power of faith and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, even in the face of adversity. The hymn's emphasis on standing firm for Jesus and wearing the "whole armour of God" resonated with people during a time of great social and political upheaval, and its message continues to inspire and motivate believers today. Despite the controversy surrounding the hymn's language and imagery, its core message of standing up for one's faith and being committed to the gospel remains a powerful and relevant message for people of all backgrounds and beliefs.

a: In the film A Beautiful Mind, the treatment for John Nash's paranoid schizophrenia is portrayed as a combination of insulin shock therapy and antipsychotic medication. Insulin shock therapy, also known as insulin coma therapy, was a controversial treatment that involved injecting patients with large doses of insulin to induce a coma, which was believed to help alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia. The treatment was used extensively in the 1940s and 1950s, but fell out of favor in the 1960s due to its risks and limited effectiveness.

In the film, Nash is given a course of insulin shock therapy, which initially seems to help his symptoms. However, he eventually stops taking his medication, believing that he can manage his symptoms on his own. This leads to a relapse, and Nash experiences a series of delusional episodes, including hallucinations of his alter ego, Charles.

The film portrays the side effects of insulin shock therapy as severe, including drowsiness, confusion, and memory loss. Nash's wife, Alicia, is shown to be concerned about the treatment's impact on her husband's cognitive abilities and overall well-being. The film also highlights the risks of the treatment, including the possibility of coma, seizures, and even death.

Despite the challenges and risks associated with insulin shock therapy, the film suggests that it was a common treatment for schizophrenia at the time and that it was seen as a last resort for patients who had not responded to other forms of treatment. The film's portrayal of insulin shock therapy is consistent with historical accounts of the treatment's use in the 1940s and 1950s.

Overall, the film's portrayal of insulin shock therapy serves to highlight the challenges and risks associated with treating schizophrenia, as well as the limitations of medical knowledge and treatment options at the time.

Frustrated with the side effects of the antipsychotic medication he is taking, which makes him lethargic and unresponsive, he secretly stops taking it.
r2: There were several treatments in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, including medication treatment with antipsychotic medication and the therapy treatment called insulin coma therapy, a form of psychiatric treatment in which patients are repeatedly injected with large doses of insulin in order to produce daily comas over several weeks.

a: The South Carolina Ordinance of Secession was written by a committee of seven members, led by Christopher G. Memminger, who were appointed by the state's secession convention to draft a separate statement justifying the delegates' decision to secede from the United States. The Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, as it was officially titled, was adopted by the convention on December 24, 1860. The document provides a legal and historical justification for South Carolina's secession, asserting that the state has the right to withdraw from the Union due to the failure of the federal government to uphold its obligations to the state.

The declaration begins by outlining the historical background of South Carolina and its relationship with the United States, highlighting the state's commitment to the principles of liberty and self-governance enshrined in the Constitution. It then asserts that the right of states to secede is implicit in the Constitution and that this right was explicitly reaffirmed by South Carolina in 1852. The document goes on to argue that the agreement between South Carolina and the United States is a compact, subject to the law of obligations, which creates obligations on both parties and can be revoked if either party fails to uphold its obligations.

The declaration then turns to the specific grievances that have led to South Carolina's secession. It asserts that the government of the United States and the governments of other states within that union have failed to uphold their obligations to South Carolina, particularly with regard to the issue of slavery. The document argues that the increasing hostility towards slavery in non-slaveholding states has made it impossible for South Carolina to continue as a member of the Union. It concludes by stating that South Carolina has therefore exercised its right to secede and is now a sovereign and independent state.

Overall, the South Carolina Ordinance of Secession and the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union provide a clear and legalistic justification for the state's decision to secede from the United States. The document emphasizes the state's commitment to the principles of liberty and self-governance, while also highlighting the specific grievances that have led to its secession. The declaration is a product of a carefully considered and deliberative process, reflecting the views of a broad cross-section of South Carolinians who were committed to preserving the institution of slavery and the state's rights as a sovereign entity.
r1: The Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, also known as the South Carolina Declaration of Secession, was a proclamation issued on December 24, 1860, by the government of South Carolina to explain its reasons for seceding from the United States. The declaration is a product of a convention organized by the state's government in the month following the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President, where it was drafted in a committee headed by Christopher G. Memminger, and a committee comprising of F. H. Wardlaw, R. W. Barnwell, J. P. Richardson, B. H. Rutledge, J. E. Jenkins, and P. E. Duncan.

a: Based on the factoids provided, the team with the most wins in a major league baseball season is the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who won 116 games with a .763 winning percentage, the highest in modern MLB history. This season was notable for the Cubs' dominant performance, led by new manager Frank Chance and four future Hall of Famers: Chance, Johnny Evers, Joe Tinker, and Mordecai Brown. The team's record of 116 wins has never been beaten, although it was tied by the 2001 Seattle Mariners (who played a longer 162-game season).

In contrast, the 2010 San Diego Padres had 36 wins and 25 losses on June 11, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for first place in the National League, despite having one of the lowest payrolls in the MLB and poor attendance. However, the Padres' ERA was one of the lowest in the National League. The team's success was largely attributed to the strong pitching and defense, with All-Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez being a key player. However, there were constant rumors and talks about the possible trade of Gonzalez.

Overall, while the 2010 San Diego Padres had a strong season, their win total and winning percentage were not as impressive as the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who hold the record for most wins in a season with 116 games and a .763 winning percentage.
r1: Although they fell to the "Hitless Wonders" White Sox in the 1906 World Series, the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the best winning percentage (.763) in Major League history. The Mariners finished with a 116–46 (.716) record, tying the major league record for wins set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs,[1] and setting the record for wins by an American League team.
r2: Seattle Mariners have the most major league baseball wins in a single season for the American League teams, and the Chicago Cubs have the most wins in a single season for the National League teams. So, both the Cubs and Mariners have the highest number of wins in a MLB season.

a: Aquatic animals, also known as marine animals or sea creatures, are living beings that inhabit water environments for most or all of their lifetime. These animals can be found in both freshwater and saltwater habitats, including oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, and estuaries. Aquatic animals are diverse and range from small invertebrates such as plankton and insects to large vertebrates like whales and sharks.

Aquatic animals have evolved specialized adaptations to survive in their aquatic environments. For example, fish have developed gills to extract oxygen from the water, while other aquatic animals such as seals and dolphins have developed breathing tubes or gills to allow them to breathe underwater. Many aquatic animals also have streamlined bodies and powerful tails or fins to help them swim and maneuver in the water.

Marine life, specifically, refers to the plants and animals that live in saltwater environments, such as oceans, seas, and estuaries. These ecosystems are incredibly diverse and provide a home for a wide range of species, from tiny plankton to massive whales. Marine life is essential to the health of our planet, as it produces much of the oxygen we breathe and helps shape our shorelines.

However, aquatic animals are facing numerous threats, including overfishing, destructive fishing practices, marine pollution, and the effects of climate change. These threats can have devastating impacts on the delicate balance of marine ecosystems and the animals that depend on them. As a result, conservation efforts are essential to protect these vital ecosystems and the animals that call them home.

In conclusion, aquatic animals are a vital and diverse group of living beings that play a critical role in the health of our planet. It is essential that we work to protect and conserve these ecosystems and the animals that depend on them, to ensure the long-term health of our planet and the survival of these incredible species.

a: The new Fallout game, Fallout 4, takes place in the post-apocalyptic world of The Commonwealth, which is set in the ruins of Boston and the surrounding Massachusetts region. The game is set in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after the Great War that devastated the United States with nuclear catastrophe. The game's setting is an open world environment that encompasses the city of Boston and the surrounding area, providing a vast and diverse landscape for players to explore.

The name "Appalachia" is mentioned in the context of Fallout 4, as the game's world is partially set in the Appalachian Mountains. The Appalachian region has a rich history and cultural heritage, and has been portrayed in various forms of media, including the popular 1960s television shows "The Andy Griffith Show" and "The Beverly Hillbillies" and James Dickey's 1970 novel "Deliverance". However, the region has undergone significant changes since the 1940s, and the game's depiction of Appalachia is a post-apocalyptic version of the region, scarred by nuclear devastation and inhabited by various factions and raider groups.

The name "Appalachia" has a unique history, as it was proposed by Washington Irving in 1839 as a name for the United States, and later taken up by Edgar Allan Poe, who considered it a better name for the country than "America" or "Alleghania". However, the name was never seriously considered, and the United States continued to be known by its current name.

a: The Tennis Court Oath was a pivotal moment in the French Revolution, marking the transition of the Estates General from a feudal assembly to a revolutionary National Assembly. In 1789, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates General to address the state's financial crisis, but the Third Estate, representing the commoners, refused to accept the traditional arrangement that gave the First and Second Estates, the clergy and nobility, greater power and representation. Instead, the Third Estate formed a National Assembly, inviting the other two estates to join, against the wishes of the King. This move signaled the end of the Estates General and the beginning of the French Revolution.

On June 20, the National Assembly met in a tennis court and swore an oath to continue their deliberations until they had established a new constitution for France. This oath, known as the Tennis Court Oath, was a bold statement of the Third Estate's determination to assert their rights and challenge the authority of the monarchy. Two days later, the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined the National Assembly, further undermining the power of the First and Second Estates.

The King, desperate to maintain his authority, granted a "Charte octroyée" or constitution granted by royal favor, which affirmed the right of separate deliberation for the three orders. However, this move failed to quell the revolutionary spirit of the National Assembly, and soon, the majority of the nobles who still stood apart joined the Assembly at the request of the King. The Estates-General had effectively ceased to exist, having been replaced by the National Assembly, which would go on to play a crucial role in shaping the course of the French Revolution.

In conclusion, the Tennis Court Oath was a turning point in the French Revolution, marking the transition from a feudal assembly to a revolutionary National Assembly. The oath symbolized the determination of the Third Estate to assert their rights and challenge the authority of the monarchy, and it paved the way for the creation of a new constitution and the end of the Estates General.
r1: In 1789, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd estates of France met on a tennis court and swore an oath known as the Tennis Court Oath at an event called the Estates General of 1789, a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm, including the clergy or First Estate, the nobility or Second Estate, and the commoners or Third Estate, the last of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France.

a: The Who played at the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show in 2010, marking a significant departure from the traditional wholesome and inoffensive halftime shows of the past. The British rock band, known for their powerful and energetic performances, played a medley of their hits, including "Pinball Wizard", "Baba O'Riley", "Who Are You", "See Me, Feel Me", and "Won't Get Fooled Again". This performance was a stark contrast to the more family-friendly halftime shows of the 1970s and 1980s, which often featured marching bands and performance ensembles such as Up with People. The halftime show was also notable for being the first time since Super Bowl XXXIV that there was no crowd of fans surrounding the stage.

The rise of counterprogramming during the Super Bowl halftime show can be traced back to Fox, which first popularized the concept with its live episode of "In Living Color" during Super Bowl XXVI. The network's decision to air a live episode of the sketch comedy show during the halftime slot was seen as a way to appeal to a younger demographic and offer an alternative to the more traditional halftime shows. The success of Fox's counterprogramming strategy paved the way for other networks to follow suit, and today, the Super Bowl halftime show is often seen as an opportunity for artists to showcase their talents and reach a massive audience.

The Who's performance at Super Bowl XLIV was also significant because it marked the 15th anniversary of the San Francisco 49ers' fifth Super Bowl victory, which took place at the same stadium. To commemorate the occasion, Jerry Rice, who had been a key player in the 49ers' victory, joined the coin toss ceremonies. Rice had recently been named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2010, along with other notable players such as Rickey Jackson, Dick LeBeau, Floyd Little, Russ Grimm, John Randle, and Emmitt Smith. The Saints ultimately won the coin toss, marking the 13th straight Super Bowl victory for the NFC.

Overall, the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIV was a highlight of the event, with the Who's powerful performance marking a departure from the more traditional halftime shows of the past. The success of counterprogramming during the Super Bowl halftime show has continued to evolve over the years, with artists such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé delivering memorable performances that have captured the attention of audiences around the world.

a: The authorship of the books of Luke and Acts has been a topic of much debate and speculation among scholars for centuries. According to the traditional view, the Gospel of Luke and Acts were written by the physician Luke, a companion of Paul. This view is supported by the earliest known manuscripts of the texts, as well as by many early Christian fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen. However, some scholars have questioned the traditional view, arguing that the author of the texts may have been a Gentile Christian rather than a Hellenistic Jew.

One of the main arguments against the traditional view is that the author of the Gospel of Luke and Acts appears to have had a different perspective and style than the other Gospel writers. For example, while the other Gospels focus primarily on the life and teachings of Jesus, the Gospel of Luke includes a longer infancy narrative and emphasizes the role of women and outsiders in the early Christian community. Additionally, the author of Acts portrays the early Christian community as being primarily Gentile, which has led some scholars to suggest that the author may have been a Gentile Christian himself.

Despite these arguments, the traditional view that the Gospel of Luke and Acts were written by the physician Luke remains the most widely accepted theory among scholars. Many scholars believe that the author of the texts was a companion of Paul, and that he wrote them as a historian and evangelist rather than as an eyewitness to the events he describes. Additionally, the fact that the author of the texts is mentioned in several early Christian texts, including Paul's Epistle to Philemon and the Muratorian Canon, supports the traditional view.

In conclusion, while the authorship of the books of Luke and Acts is still a topic of debate among scholars, the traditional view that they were written by the physician Luke remains the most widely accepted theory. The evidence from early Christian texts and the style and perspective of the texts themselves support this view, and it is the perspective of many scholars that the author of the texts was a companion of Paul who wrote as a historian and evangelist rather than as an eyewitness.
r1: There are multiple views on who wrote the books of Luke and Acts. According to the traditional view, they were written by the physician Luke, a companion of Paul. The critical view holds that they were written by an anonymous non-eyewitness who was not an eyewitness of any of the events he described and had no eyewitness sources.
r2: There are several views on who wrote the books of Luke and Acts. According to the traditional view, they were written by the physician Luke. According to the critical views, they were written by an anonymous non-eyewitness who was not an eyewitness of any of the events he described and who had no eyewitness sources or were written by an anonymous writer or the traditional Luke using existing written sources such as a travelogue by an eyewitness.

a: Nicolaus Copernicus' groundbreaking work, "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), was published in 1543, just before his death. This seminal work presented the heliocentric theory, which posited that the Sun, rather than the Earth, was at the center of the universe. The book was published in Nuremberg, Holy Roman Empire, and was dedicated to Pope Paul III, with a preface arguing that mathematics, not physics, should be the basis for understanding and accepting the new theory. The book was divided into six "books" or sections, following the layout of Ptolemy's "Almagest" and replacing it as the leading astronomical text. Copernicus' revolutionary idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, and not the other way around, challenged the widely accepted geocentric system and marked a significant turning point in the history of astronomy.

a: The Wicked Witch of the West, as portrayed by Margaret Hamilton in the 1939 film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," is one of the most iconic and enduring villains in American pop culture. While the character only appears in Baum's first Oz novel and is not featured prominently in his subsequent works, her portrayal by Hamilton in the film has become the definitive interpretation of the character. Hamilton's Witch is a green-skinned, wicked and power-hungry ruler of the Winkie Country, who is aquaphobic and obsessed with obtaining the magical silver shoes worn by Dorothy Gale.

The 1939 film adaptation of "The Wizard of Oz," directed by Victor Fleming and starring Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Margaret Hamilton, is widely considered to be one of the greatest films in cinema history. It was a commercial success and has become an icon of American popular culture, with its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, and memorable characters. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won two, including Best Original Song for "Over the Rainbow" and Best Original Score by Herbert Stothart.

In contrast to the sinister portrayal of the Witch in the film, Miss Gulch Returns! is a one-man musical comedy that parodies the character of Almira Gulch, as portrayed by Margaret Hamilton in "The Wizard of Oz." The show, written and performed by Fred Barton, blurs the line between fiction and reality by portraying Gulch as a neurotic nightclub performer who is obsessed with obtaining the magical silver shoes. The show features Barton as himself, attempting to pick up Gulch in a cabaret bar, and then adopting her personality for the evening.

Overall, the Wicked Witch of the West is a complex and enduring character who has captured the imaginations of audiences for generations. From her origins in L. Frank Baum's classic novel to her iconic portrayal in the 1939 film adaptation, and even in parodic interpretations like Miss Gulch Returns!, the Witch remains a symbol of evil and villainy in American pop culture.
r1: The Wicked Witch of the West has been in a number of films, specials, and miniseries with "Oz" in the title. Margaret Hamilton played the character in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, and Mila Kunis did in the 2013 film Oz the Great and Powerful.

a: The musculoskeletal system is a complex organ system that enables humans to move, support their body, and protect vital organs. It is composed of bones, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that work together to provide form, support, stability, and movement to the body. The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage system for calcium and phosphorus and contains critical components of the hematopoietic system. The bones provide stability and support, while muscles keep bones in place and enable movement through the attachment of tendons and ligaments. Joints allow for the movement of bones, and cartilage prevents bone ends from rubbing directly against each other.

The musculoskeletal system performs several vital functions, including supporting the body, allowing motion, and protecting vital organs. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining posture, regulating body movements, and facilitating locomotion. The system's primary functions are supported by the intricate network of bones, muscles, and connective tissue that work together to maintain the body's overall structure and function.

However, the musculoskeletal system can be affected by various diseases and disorders, such as osteoporosis, arthritis, and muscle strains, which can adversely impact its function and overall effectiveness. These conditions can cause pain, limited mobility, and decreased quality of life, highlighting the importance of proper care and maintenance of the musculoskeletal system. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and proper medical care can help to prevent and manage these conditions, ensuring the continued health and function of the musculoskeletal system.

The song was first published by Leo Feist, Inc. in New York and features a photo of Collins and Harlin on the sheet music cover. The song's lyrics reflect the uncertainty and longing of the time, with the title line taken from a TV reporter's comment during the broadcast of the 1969 moon landing.

Fast forward to the 1970s, and the song was covered by the American rock band Chicago on their second studio album. This version, written by bassist Peter Cetera, deals with the themes of love and unity in the midst of social upheaval, specifically the Vietnam War. The song was released as the B-side to the single "25 or 6 to 4" and reached number four on the Pop Singles chart in June 1970. The live performance of the song can be found on the band's 1971 album "Chicago at Carnegie Hall."

Both versions of "Where Do We Go From Here?" capture the spirit of their respective times, with the original version reflecting the uncertainty and longing of World War I and the later version addressing the social and political turmoil of the 1970s. The song's message of love and unity remains relevant today, urging listeners to embrace each other in the face of adversity and find a way forward in the midst of uncertainty.

a: In the classic tale "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," written by L. Frank Baum, there is a character named the Tin Woodman who lacks a heart. The Tin Woodman was originally an ordinary man named Nick Chopper, who was transformed into a tin man by the Wicked Witch of the West as a punishment for refusing to marry her. The Witch enchanted his axe to prevent him from marrying anyone else, and the Tin Woodman lived a lonely and heartless existence, chopping down trees in the forests of Oz.

In the story, the Tin Woodman joins Dorothy and her friends on their journey to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard of Oz, who they believe can help them find their hearts' desires. However, the Wizard is revealed to be a humbug and is unable to grant the Tin Woodman a heart. Instead, it is the love and friendship of Dorothy and her friends that ultimately give the Tin Woodman the heart he has been seeking.

a: The longest serving manager in the Premier League is Arsène Wenger, who managed Arsenal for 22 years from 1996 to 2018, a total of 828 matches. Wenger broke the record previously held by Sir Alex Ferguson, who managed Manchester United for 27 years from the inception of the Premier League in 1992 until his retirement in 2013. Ferguson managed 810 matches in the Premier League, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers in the history of the sport.

Caretaker appointments, or managers who fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment, have been a common occurrence in the Premier League. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur. However, the high turnover of managers in the Premier League has also led to a number of studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings.

One such study, conducted by Professor Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, found that the average tenure of a Premier League manager is just over 18 months. This is significantly shorter than the tenure of managers in other European leagues, such as Spain and Germany, where managers typically remain in their positions for much longer.

The reasons for the high turnover of managers in the Premier League are complex and multifaceted. Some factors contributing to the high turnover include the intense competition and financial pressures of the league, the constant scrutiny of the media and fans, and the pressure to achieve success and avoid relegation. Additionally, the Premier League's strict financial regulations and the presence of wealthy owners who are willing to invest heavily in their clubs can also contribute to the high turnover of managers.

Despite the high turnover of managers, the Premier League has produced some of the greatest managers in the history of the sport, including Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger. These managers have not only achieved success on the pitch, but have also played a significant role in shaping the Premier League into the highly competitive and entertaining league that it is today.
r1: Arsène Wenger holds the record for most games managed in the Premier League with 828 games. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 games. Alex Ferguson managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013, so in terms of time, he is the longest serving manager in the Premier League.
r2: The Premier League is the top tier of professional football in England. The league was formed in 1992 as a replacement for the original Football League First Division. More than 240 managers have taken charge of the 49 clubs which have played in the Premier League. Arsène Wenger holds the record for most games managed in the Premier League with 828 games, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 games with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. In terms of time, however, Alex Ferguson has managed in the premier league for the longest.

a: The Bay of Pigs invasion took place in the Bay of Pigs, an inlet of the Gulf of Cazones located on the southern coast of Cuba. The invasion was a failed military operation undertaken by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-sponsored paramilitary group Brigade 2506 on April 17, 1961. The invasion was aimed at overthrowing the increasingly communist government of Fidel Castro, who had come to power in a revolution in 1959. The invasion force was made up of mostly Cuban exiles who had traveled to the United States after Castro's takeover, as well as some US military personnel. The invasion was launched from Guatemala and Nicaragua, but was defeated within three days by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, under the direct command of Castro.

The Bay of Pigs is located approximately 150 miles southeast of Havana, and is historically important for the failed invasion. The area is known for its diving, with an abundance of marine fauna to be found in the bay. The bay is also home to a private island owned by former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which features twenty mansions, a helipad, and yachts. The invasion took place in the context of a deteriorating relationship between the United States and Cuba, which had been a close ally of the US before the revolution. The coup of 1952 led by General Fulgencio Batista, an ally of the US, against President Carlos Prio, forced Prio into exile to Miami, Florida. This led to the rise of the 26th July Movement led by Castro, which severed the country's formerly strong links with the US. The invasion was an attempt by the US to reverse this trend and restore a more favorable government in Cuba.

The Bay of Pigs invasion is significant not only for its military and political implications, but also for its cultural and environmental importance. The area is home to a diverse array of marine life, and the bay is a popular site for diving. The invasion also highlights the complex and often contentious relationship between the US and Cuba, and the ongoing tensions between the two countries. Overall, the Bay of Pigs invasion is a significant event in modern history, with far-reaching consequences for both the US and Cuba.
r1: The Bay of Pigs Invasion was a failed landing operation financed by the US government in 1961. The invasion took place at Bays of Pigs, Cuba, which is an inlet of the Gulf of Cazones located on the southwestern coast of Cuba.

a: Sure! Here's a comprehensive, well-structured, and well-integrated paragraph that answers the question "Where is sperm made in the human body?" based on the provided factoid context:

Sperm are produced in the male reproductive system, specifically within the testes and epididymis. The process of spermatogenesis begins in the testes, where spermatogonial stem cells located near the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules divide in a centripetal direction to produce immature sperm. As the sperm mature, they are stored in the epididymis until ejaculation. The location of the testes and epididymis is crucial for spermatogenesis, as the process requires a lower temperature than the rest of the body to produce viable sperm. The ideal temperature range for spermatogenesis is 1°-8°C lower than the normal body temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). While small fluctuations in temperature may not impair sperm viability or count, significant changes can disrupt the process. The entire process of spermatogenesis is estimated to take approximately 74 days based on tritium-labelled biopsies and 120 days based on DNA clock measurements. Abnormalities in spermatogenesis can result in congenital defects, abnormal birth defects, and spontaneous abortion of the developing fetus. Therefore, the proper functioning of spermatogenesis is essential for male fertility and reproductive health.
r1: Spermatogenesis is the process by which sperm develop from germ cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. In this process, cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide to produce immature sperm. The sperm then move to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation.

This is according to the provided Wikipedia pages for Hurricane Edith (1971). Prior to making landfall in Louisiana, Edith had made landfall in Central America as a Category 5 hurricane, causing significant damage and loss of life. The storm rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana and eventually dissipating over northwestern Georgia. The National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning for the area from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana, 18 hours before the hurricane made landfall. Officials in Belize also ordered the mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas, resulting in hundreds of residents leaving the country through the international airport.
r1: Hurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. Edith landed on Cape Gracias a Dios, Nicaragua on September 9.

a: The United States began using zip codes in 1963, when the United States Postal Service (USPS) introduced the system as a way to improve the efficiency of mail delivery. The term "ZIP" is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan, and the code consists of five digits that refer to a specific geographic area. An expanded ZIP+4 code was introduced in 1983, which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code plus four additional digits that provide a more specific location within the delivery area. Although the ZIP+4 code was intended to be mandatory, it has not been widely adopted and is currently not required for mail delivery. The use of ZIP codes has become an essential part of the US mail system, with mail being sorted and delivered using the ZIP code and other identifying information, such as the Intelligent Mail barcode. The early history of postal codes in the US can be traced back to the use of postal district/zone numbers in the 1940s, which were eventually replaced by the ZIP code system in the 1960s.
r1: The first use of the five digit zip code from the United States Postal Service was July 1, 1963. The use of the zip+4, five digits and hyphen followed by 4 more digits, came 20 years later in 1983. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan, and it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly, when senders use the code in the postal address. Adding the additional 4 numbers designated a more specific destination.
r2: The USPS started utilizing zip codes on July 1, 1963 and the extended zip code plus 4 digits in 1983.

a: The song "That Was Then, This Is Now" has an interesting history, with two different versions recorded by two different bands, The Monkees and ABC. The Monkees' version was originally written by Vance Brescia for his band The Mosquitos, but it was Clive Davis of Arista Records who saw potential in the song and chose it as the Monkees' comeback single for their 20th anniversary tour. The Monkees, consisting of Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork at the time, recorded the song for Arista Records, which was included on the compilation album "Then & Now... The Best of The Monkees" in June 1986. The album was a success, going platinum during the tour, and the song itself became a surprise hit, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 24 on the adult contemporary chart. This was the band's first Top 40 hit since "D.W. Washburn" in 1968.

On the other hand, the song "That Was Then but This Is Now" was recorded by the English band ABC and was released in late 1983 as the lead single from their second studio album, "Beauty Stab." The song peaked at number 89 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The music video for the song features the band playing on a stage behind a huge Risk-style world map gameboard, interspersed with scenes of a helicopter taking off and exploding.

Despite the different versions and chart performances, both songs share a common theme of looking back on past experiences and how they have shaped the present. The lyrics of both songs reflect on the passing of time and the changes that have occurred, with a focus on the present moment and the realization that "this is now." The two songs offer a nostalgic look back at the past while also embracing the present and looking forward to the future.

a: Sybil Ludington, a young woman from Putnam County, New York, played a crucial role in alerting the colonists that the British were coming during the American Revolutionary War. On the night of April 26, 1777, at the age of 16, she rode more than twice the distance attributed to Paul Revere to alert militia forces in villages of Putnam County and Danbury, Connecticut. Her ride was similar to those performed by Revere and other patriots, such as Jack Jouett and William Dawes, who warned the colonists of the approaching British forces. Unlike these men, however, Ludington was just a teenager at the time of her heroic act.

Ludington's ride was prompted by the arrival of a message from her father, who was a colonel in the local militia, alerting him to the approach of British troops. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Ludington set out on her horse to warn the militia forces in the nearby villages. She rode through the night, facing challenging terrain and dangerous conditions, to ensure that the colonists were prepared for the impending attack. Her ride was so successful that it helped to mobilize the militia forces and prepare them for the Battle of Ridgefield, which took place on April 27, 1777.

Ludington's heroism was not widely recognized until the early 20th century, when her story was first published by local historian Martha Lamb. Since then, Ludington has been celebrated as a heroine of the American Revolution, with memorial statues and books written about her. Her ride is seen as a symbol of the bravery and determination of the colonists in the face of British oppression.

In contrast to Ludington, Samuel Prescott was an express courier for the Sons of Liberty and the Committees of Correspondence, and played a crucial role in alerting the colonists of the approaching British forces. He was in Lexington on the evening of April 18, 1775, when Paul Revere and William Dawes were dispatched to warn the countryside. Prescott left Lexington the next morning, April 19, to report on Concord's readiness and to warn the colonists of the approaching British.

Similarly, Jack Jouett, a captain in the 16th Regiment of the Virginia militia, is known as the "Paul Revere of the South" for his late night ride to warn Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia legislature of the approach of British cavalry. Jouett's ride took place on March 23, 1781, and was successful in alerting the colonists of the impending attack.

In conclusion, Sybil Ludington, Samuel Prescott, and Jack Jouett were all instrumental in alerting the colonists of the approaching British forces during the American Revolutionary War. Their heroic acts, along with those of other patriots, helped to mobilize the colonists and prepare them for battle. Their bravery and determination are a testament to the spirit of the revolution and the fight for independence.
r1: There were several who warned the colonists that the British were coming, including Sybil Ludington, who reportedly did on April 26, 1777, and Kate Barry, who did in 1781. Paul Revere, Samuel Prescott, Israel Bissell, Robert Newman, and William Dawes warned the colonists that the British were coming in April 1775. Jack Jouett warned Thomas Jefferson that the British were coming.
r2: Many people warned the colonists that the British were coming. On the evening of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere and William Dawes were dispatched by Joseph Warren to warn the countryside that the British were coming. Samuel Prescott was also a part of Paul Revere's "midnight ride". Israel Bissell, a patriot post rider, brought news to American colonists of the British attack on Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Robert Newman is considered a patriot for hanging lanterns in his church's steeple on April 18, 1775, part of a warning signal devised by Paul Revere during the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Sybil Ludington is celebrated as a heroine of the American Revolutionary War because she reportedly rode to alert militia forces in the towns of Putnam County, New York and Danbury, Connecticut on the night of April 26, 1777 at age 16, warning of the approach of the British regular forces. In 1781, Catherine Moore Barry warned the colonists the British were coming which prepared the colonial forces to defeat the British governor, Cornwallis and his men and drive them north, out of the state of South Carolina. John Jouett Jr., sometimes called the "Paul Revere of the South", rode to warn Thomas Jefferson, then the outgoing governor of Virginia that British cavalry had been sent to capture them.

a: The original version of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" was performed and recorded by the Charlie Daniels Band, which was released on their 1979 album "Million Mile Reflections". The song was written by Charlie Daniels and Vassar Clements, who originally wrote the basic melody in a tune called "Lonesome Fiddle Blues" released on Clements' self-titled 1975 album, with Daniels playing guitar. The Charlie Daniels Band moved the melody up an octave and added lyrics to create the iconic song we know today. The unique aspect of the song is that the verses are closer to spoken recitation rather than traditional singing, telling the story of a boy named Johnny in a variant of the classic deal with the devil. The performances of Satan and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges.

The song was a huge success for the Charlie Daniels Band, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, but was prevented from reaching the top spot by other popular songs of the time, such as "After The Love Has Gone" by Earth, Wind and Fire and "My Sharona" by The Knack. The song's tempo was set by Patsy Swayze, the choreographer of the 1980 film "Urban Cowboy", in which the song was featured. The song's success can be attributed to its catchy melody, memorable lyrics, and the band's skilled musicianship, particularly Charlie Daniels' virtuosic fiddle playing. The song has become a classic of southern rock and country music, and its legacy continues to endure to this day.

Paracelsus is credited with founding the field of toxicology through his groundbreaking work in the study of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms. In his seminal work, "Traité des poisons" (1536), also known as "Toxicologie générale", Paracelsus provided the first formal treatment of toxicology, laying the foundation for the field and establishing it as a distinct discipline.

Paracelsus's contributions to toxicology were significant and far-reaching. He recognized the importance of understanding the relationship between dose and effect, and he developed the concept of the "dose-response curve", which remains a fundamental principle of toxicology to this day. Additionally, he identified the key factors that influence chemical toxicity, including the dosage, route of exposure, species, age, sex, and environment.

Paracelsus's work in toxicology was not limited to his written treatises. He was also a pioneer in the field of clinical toxicology, and he developed several techniques for diagnosing and treating exposures to toxins and poisons. For example, he developed the use of vegetable poisons to treat certain medical conditions, and he introduced the use of opium to relieve pain.

Paracelsus's legacy in toxicology has endured for centuries, and his work continues to influence the field to this day. His emphasis on the importance of observation and the value of combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience remains a cornerstone of modern toxicology. Moreover, his holistic approach to medicine, which integrated the study of the body, the mind, and the environment, has had a lasting impact on the field of toxicology and beyond.

In conclusion, Paracelsus is rightly regarded as the father of toxicology. His groundbreaking work in the field has had a profound and lasting impact on our understanding of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms, and his contributions continue to shape the field of toxicology to this day.

a: The tallest person on Earth is Robert Wadlow, also known as the Alton Giant, who reached a height of 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) at the time of his death in 1940. Wadlow's exceptional height was due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which resulted in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone (HGH). He was born in Alton, Illinois, and his height became well-known as he grew older, with his height reaching 8 ft 4 in (2.54 m) by the time he was 12 years old. Despite his size, Wadlow was able to walk and move around without the use of a wheelchair, although he did require leg braces to support his legs. He attended college and pursued a career in law, but his health began to decline in his early twenties, and he passed away at the age of 22 due to an infection.

While Trijntje Keever, a Dutch woman who lived in the 17th century, is often claimed to be the tallest female person in recorded history, her height is not as well-documented as Wadlow's. According to some sources, Keever reached a height of 9 Amsterdam feet (approximately 8 ft 4 in or 2.54 m) at the age of 17, before passing away from cancer. However, her height is not as well-documented as Wadlow's, and there is some debate among historians and medical professionals about the accuracy of her height measurements.

In comparison, the tallest person currently living, Kristian Matsson, who performs under the stage name The Tallest Man on Earth, is 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) tall. While he is significantly shorter than Wadlow and Keever, he has gained recognition for his charismatic stage presence and his music, which has drawn comparisons to the music of Bob Dylan.

Overall, while there may be some debate about the tallest person in recorded history, Robert Wadlow's height of 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) is widely recognized as the highest recorded height for a human being.

a: The five major circles of latitude on Earth are the Equator, the Tropic of Cancer, the Tropic of Capricorn, the Arctic Circle, and the Antarctic Circle. These circles are perpendicular to all meridians and are used to divide the Earth into five principal geographical zones. The Equator is the longest circle of latitude and the only great circle, while the other circles are smaller and centered only on Earth's axis. The Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn mark the northernmost and southernmost latitudes at which the sun may be seen directly overhead, respectively, while the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle mark the northernmost and southernmost latitudes at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours. The positions of these circles depend on the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun, and their latitudes are approximately equal to 90° minus the Earth's axial tilt. These circles of latitude have been used as boundaries between countries or regions, and have played a significant role in the definition of geographical zones and the distribution of natural resources.

a: The National Hockey League (NHL) has undergone a significant transformation regarding the nationalities and ethnicities of its players since its inception. Once a predominantly Canadian and mono-ethnic league, the NHL has become a diverse and inclusive institution, with players from various countries and backgrounds. According to statistics from www.quanthockey.com, the percentage of Canadian players in the league has decreased from 75% in the 1980s to slightly less than 50% today. In 2011, the NHL was composed of 93% white players and 7% players of varying ethnicities.

The inclusion of players from different backgrounds can be traced back to the 1970s, when the NHL began to expand its reach beyond Canada, with players from the United States, Sweden, and Finland joining the league. This shift towards diversity can also be attributed to the establishment of ice hockey leagues for players of African descent in Canada, such as the Coloured Hockey League, which was established in 1895 and operated across the Maritime provinces for several decades.

Despite the progress made towards a more diverse and inclusive league, the NHL still grapples with issues of racism and exclusivity. However, the league has taken steps to address these issues, such as implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives and increasing the representation of minority players in the league. As the NHL continues to evolve, it is likely that the percentage of Canadian players will continue to decrease, and the league will become even more diverse and inclusive.
r1: The National Hockey League (NHL) evolved from a mono-ethnic and primarily Canadian professional athletic league to span North America.

a: The flat iron cut of meat originates from the shoulder of the beef animal, specifically located adjacent to the heart of the shoulder clod, under the seven or paddle bone (shoulder blade or scapula). It is a flavorful cut that is a bit tough due to the presence of a gristly fascia membrane, which is often removed to enhance its tenderness. Despite its toughness, flat iron steak is a popular choice among meat enthusiasts due to its rich flavor and lower price point compared to more popular cuts like rib-eye and strip steaks. The cut encompasses the infraspinatus muscles of beef and is sometimes referred to as "top blade" roast in butcher shops and meat markets. Anatomically, the muscle forms the dorsal part of the rotator cuff of the steer, and is distinct from the shoulder tender, which lies directly below it. Flat iron steaks typically have a significant amount of marbling, which adds to their flavor and tenderness. This cut is often used as a means of selling a less expensive cut from the same animal, such as Kobe beef, and is a popular option for those looking for a flavorful and affordable steak.
r1: The general body part a flat iron cut of meat comes from is the shoulder of a beef animal, while the part of the shoulder it comes from is adjacent to the heart of the shoulder clod, under the seven or paddle bone, and a flat iron cut of meat encompasses the infraspinatus muscles.

It is located adjacent to the heart of the shoulder clod, under the seven or paddle bone (shoulder blade or scapula). The steak encompasses the infraspinatus muscles of beef, and one may see this displayed in some butcher shops and meat markets as a top blade roast or informally called a "patio steak".

The voice switch between Chabert and Kunis can be heard in the first two seasons of the show, with Kunis's voice first appearing in Episode 3 of Season 2, "Da Boom." Despite her unpopularity in high school and her family's neglect, Meg is a self-conscious and insecure adolescent girl who desperately tries to fit in with the cool crowd.

a: The phrase "under God" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a Joint Resolution of Congress amending § 4 of the Flag Code. This change was made following a sermon delivered by George MacPherson Docherty, the pastor of the National Presbyterian Church in Washington D.C., on February 7, 1954. Docherty argued that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation, and that the phrase "under God" was missing, which defined the US and set it apart from other nations. President Eisenhower, who was present in the church and had recently been baptized as a Presbyterian, enthusiastically supported the idea and acted on it the next day. On February 8, 1954, Rep. Charles Oakman (R-Mich.) introduced a bill to amend the Pledge, and Congress passed the necessary legislation. President Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954. The addition of "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance was a deliberate attempt to emphasize the religious and spiritual foundations of American identity and to distinguish the US from other nations. This change has been the subject of some controversy and legal challenges over the years, with some arguing that it violates the principle of separation of church and state.
r1: The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America.

a: The practice of baptism in early Christianity can be traced back to the Jewish tradition of ritual washing, specifically the practice of tevilah, which involved full body immersion in a mikveh. This practice was codified in various codes of Jewish law and tradition, such as Maimonides' "Mishneh Torah" and Joseph Karo's "Shulchan Aruch." The concept of baptism was also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where it was referred to as a purification rite, and was elaborated upon in the Mishnah and Talmud.

During Jesus' ministry, he likened his own baptism by John the Baptist to the baptism that his followers would undergo, which was seen as a form of purification and a preparation for the coming kingdom. This idea was recorded in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of Mark, which states that those who believe and are baptized will be saved, but those who do not believe will be condemned. This idea of baptism as a form of purification and salvation was likely influenced by the Jewish tradition of ritual washing, and was seen as a way to cleanse oneself of sin and become a follower of Jesus.

The practice of baptism in early Christianity was not only a physical act of immersion, but also a spiritual one, as it symbolized the believer's death to sin and their new life in Christ. The idea of baptism as a form of purification and salvation was not limited to Jesus' teachings, but was also reflected in the teachings of the early Church Fathers, such as St. John Chrysostom, who saw baptism as a means of washing away sin and being reborn in Christ.

In conclusion, the practice of baptism in early Christianity was deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition of ritual washing, and was seen as a form of purification and salvation. The idea of baptism as a means of cleansing oneself of sin and becoming a follower of Jesus was central to the teachings of Jesus and the early Church, and continues to be an important practice in Christianity today.
r1: The practice of baptism comes from John the Baptist and originated in the Middle East, while the ritual of baptism also has its roots in a Tevilah, which is a full-body immersion in a mikveh and one of two main forms of ritual washing in Judaism.
r2: John the Baptist, who is considered a forerunner to Christianity, used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism. Although the term "baptism" is not used to describe the Jewish rituals, the purification rites in Halakha Jewish law and tradition, called tvilah or tevilah, a full body immersion, have some similarity to baptism, and the two have been linked. The practice of baptism originated in the Middle East.
