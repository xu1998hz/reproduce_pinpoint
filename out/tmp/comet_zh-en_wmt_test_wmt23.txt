mt: The report states that the ecology of content in the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Only professional produced content (PGC) and user-generated content (UGC) serve as effective carriers for the integration of content and e-commerce. The higher the value of content platforms, the more diverse the scenarios for consumption and promotion, and the higher the potential for e-commerce penetration, resulting in greater business value. The ratio of content production and consumption in the public domain and private domain of e-commerce is also likely to increase as these domains continue to converge.
ref: The article suggests that while not all content is relevant to e-commerce, there is a strong connection between e-commerce and content, user-generated and professional content can serve as a valuable tool for integrating e-commerce, the more opportunities for consumption and promotion, the more valuable the content platform becomes, as the distinction between public and private domains becomes less clear, there will be an increase in e-commerce content development and consumption.

mt: I initially purchased size options of 7c, 8, 9c on the website. I thought this was a trap, so I called the Dayas Japanese customer service and clarified that 8 was 8c. However, when the product arrived in China, I found out it was only 8cm in size. I believe this was intentionally set up to deceive Chinese customers (according to Amazon's return policy). Now, the size options on the page no longer include this choice.
ref: I first purchased the 7c, 8, and 9c page size options, I initially believed this to be a trap, I informed Nichia's Chinese customer care that 8 was 8c, However, after the item was sent back to China, I learned that it was actually just 8 cm, according to Amazon's after-sales support, it is a full trap that was set up specifically to catch Chinese people, and as of right now, no such choice is available on the viewing page.

mt: I don't understand this logic anymore. I'm Japanese, but I still need a Chinese customer service. People living in China in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, but as a tourist in Japan, I don't have the ability to make international long-distance calls, so the question is, who needs to call Amazon's overseas customer service in Chinese, besides people like me who shop on Japanese sites.
ref: This reasoning baffles me once more, I need Chinese customer service despite being Japanese, Customer service from Chinese speakers in Japan is unnecessary, the ability to place international long-distance calls is not a talent that visitors to Japan possess, who needs to call, This then becomes a question, nothing more than regular purchasing for me, Amazon is buying Chinese phones from other countries.

mt: This is my second purchase of Huggies diapers from Amazon. I bought a box for my baby when he was two months old, and I chose the European paper version. My first purchase was quite satisfying, as my baby used one diaper throughout the night, and it could indeed last for 12 hours without needing a change.

============================1460============================
0.7451748251914978
src: 我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。
mt: I believe this collection of short stories, along with its title, is akin to a performing art, conveying that love is not just the dramatic ups and downs on stage, or the clichéd tales of the city, nor is it merely you and me, but rather, love is also the mundane, tasteless routine of daily life, the helplessness towards reality, the escape from the present, and the uncertainty of the future.
ref: I consider the title of this anthology of novels to be a type of performance art, the author aims to convey that love is more than only the emotions experienced on stage, the rocks and dry sea in urban tales, and the bond that binds you and I together, not only should the aforementioned not be seen as a representation of love, but also of a life that is dull day in and day out, as plain as water, with a loss of life, denial of reality, and uncertainty about the future.

A more accurate translation would be: "I, being born in China, am a little confused.") However, if we assume the intended meaning is that the speaker is currently living in China and is confused about something, a possible translation would be: "I'm confused living in China."

mt: I still prefer buying items from Amazon's own store. Buying overseas now is quite convenient, and the clearance time for goods to be delivered from overseas to home is only a few days more than domestic purchases. Amazon's clearance ability for overseas purchases to be delivered domestically is quite strong, much faster than using a freight forwarder. Therefore, many things are now being bought on Amazon Global Store.
ref: I still have faith in Amazon's autonomous products, the shipping period is now only a few days longer than domestic ones, making it incredibly simple to purchase internationally, I must admit that Amazon still has excellent customs clearance capabilities for purchases made outside of China; this is quicker than transshipment, nowadays so many products are bought abroad, which is much faster.

mt: The reviews I read were all good, so I was looking forward to this pot. When I held it in my hands, I liked it because it was light. However, I found a problem when I started cooking. The bottom of the pot is not flat; it protrudes in the middle and sinks in around the edges, causing the oil to pool at the edges instead of covering the central area where I had specifically bought large pieces of meat to cook. The pot couldn't be used for cooking properly in this condition.
ref: Everyone is anticipating this pot because of the positive comments, When I first got it, I really liked it, although it is quite lightweight, there was an issue when I opened the pot, the pot's bottom is not perfectly flat, the oil has spread to the edges if it has sunk, Large, fatty meat that was particularly purchased is fried in so much oil that it cannot cover the entire surface of the pot.

The low-pitch effects were not as good as before, and there were some background noise.

mt: Let me explain the packaging again. It's just a few layers of preservative film, with no packaging foam or plastic inside. When you open it, all the parts are just lying freely in an empty box. The toy quality is not bad, but there are fewer pieces than expected since it's not battery-operated. However, it often derails when pushed by hand due to the wide gaps on the tracks, which seems poorly designed.
ref: Let's talk about the packaging once more, it's just wrapped in plastic wrap for a few layers, not even a package of plastic bubble wrap inside, when you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box, fortunately the quality of the toy is good, no broken parts, however, it is much smaller than expected because it is not battery-operated, and it frequently derails when being pushed by hand, I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the spacing between the wheels is too wide.

Don't they sell these incomplete or low-quality products?

src: 买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。
mt: After purchasing it, there weren't any major issues, but I couldn't connect to the software during setup. I have a TP router at home, and after searching online, I found that many people had the same problem. I spent over two hours trying to change the router settings, but eventually used 360WIFI as a mediator to resolve the issue. I contacted Xiaomi customer service about this problem, but they didn't have a solution and instructed me to contact Amazon for a refund.
ref: Other things were fine once I got it, but when the program was connected, I was unable to connect, a TP router is at my house, I discovered after searching the Internet that this issue affects a lot of people, more than two hours later, I made several adjustments, in the end, I configured the router using 360WIFI as the medium, during that time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have an answer for this issue, they merely instructed me to get in touch with Amazon for customer support.
