mt: From a mechanical perspective, addressing issues of single question types, repetitive questions, and so on in university examinations is a topic of concern. Of course, appropriate regulations are required, but the essence lies in teachers having a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It's not just about mastering the teaching content, but also about mastering the students' learning situation. Both ends must be understood, allowing for better alignment between teaching and learning, resulting in positive interactions, and exams that are more reflective of reality. Consequently, "study kings" and "study failures" will each achieve their respective outcomes.
ref: Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.

mt: The essence of "the next-step principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" — it encourages a theory of "winning through small victories." If you can't do a hundred, doing one is sufficient: one is always greater than zero. If you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small hill at your doorstep is still better than standing still.
ref: The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.

mt: We cannot discuss false requirements, but rather the refined results of genuine needs, when it comes to picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for audio-visual enthusiasts, those who require both large screens and satisfactory viewing environments may consider it, every event has its pros and cons, weigh the advantages and disadvantages before making a decision, be wary of one-sided information.
ref: It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.

mt: Another thing, I really dislike how projection manufacturers brag about matte screens for the eyes, please note that the light on the screen that the eyes can see is essentially direct light. If you reflect it onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. Even if it's a precise liquid crystal TV, it's still "direct" reflection on the TV screen, isn't the TV screen lit up when the ceiling is opened?
ref: Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused “direct light”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?

mt: According to the stipulations in the "Regulations on the Administration of Insurance Agencies (Revised in 2015)": to establish an insurance agency, one must satisfy three key conditions: having shareholders, no major legal records of wrongdoing in the past three years, a minimum registered capital of RMB 500 million, and approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
ref: In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.

mt: These three requirements are quite stringent. In summary, one must have the capability, receive approval from the National regulatory authority for insurance companies and banks (China's regulatory body), and have good conduct among shareholders, for a raincoat insurance company like Small Rain Umbrella Insurance. Policyholders need not question the legitimacy of Small Rain Umbrella Insurance excessively, as these three barriers are not easily met by every insurance company.
ref: These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.

mt: From an insurance product perspective, Rainy Day Insurance is like an insurance marketplace. Many companies' star critical illness insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the latest Marvel Super 5 Critical Illness Insurance, with both the claims and underwriting parties being AIA Thailand. Rainy Day Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there's no need to question its credibility.

mt: From a payment mode perspective, the products on internet platforms have a higher value-for-money ratio than traditional insurance due to the absence of business location operating costs and employee wages. The payment methods are also flexible, allowing for monthly installments, reducing the burden on policyholders, and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
ref: In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.

mt: From a salesperson's professionalism perspective, this is particularly important because the insurance industry has very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which may lead to many misconceptions, especially in the areas of health disclosure and occupation. Non-insurance salespeople often add their subjective opinions during the insurance application process, leading to potential claims issues and the risk of being denied.
ref: In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.

mt: For example, "1 yuan insurance covers 600 million, buy insurance get a free phone, receive 60,000 yuan of critical illness coverage for free," these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are light on the heavy stuff. They don't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, but the next months require regular payment, which can be several tens to hundreds of yuan. Many customers are unclear about what they have bought after deducting fees for a few years.
ref: For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they’ve been charged for one or two years.

mt: For the insured, this is another pitfall. A free coverage of 60,000 RMB for critical illness, which is short-term, is insufficient if there is no other commercial insurance. If a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 RMB won't be enough to solve the problem, leaving a bare living situation in the future.
ref: (This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
