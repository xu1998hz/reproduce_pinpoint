Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature.

Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States." Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms. He noted, "What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration.

The source is 'There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning. In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario. In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence. At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings. We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end. Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication. We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts.

This will not be so frequent.

I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file. One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model. And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied. So, the dictionary will have three col ns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form. So that is when the language model sees.

The source is '(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah. So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated. And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call. So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so. And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself. So, I call it "do-it-yourself integration". So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else. So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself. So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded. So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done. [PERSON4], right? The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs?

The source is '(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think. So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines. And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever. Simply play them. Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works. Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear. It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline.

The source is '(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English. So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved. Ah, so that's one particle experiment. And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during the training. They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.'. The model generated translation is '(PERSON17) Ja, also für die vielakzentige Englische Sprache. also leiten wir jetzt das zusammen in eine technische Lösung.

The source is '(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing. Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document. It is highlighted four times. So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session. And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat. And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible. So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced. So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files. And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster. Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it. So there this skill is something that that we need people to have. And we need someone to be responsible for that. And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8]. If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so. And then we need - So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems. So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR. So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday. [PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up. So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5].

The source is 'So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works. At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR. So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure. So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time. End-to-end ASR, which is better in general. And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords. And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms. So that's my suggestion of what we could do. And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that.

Error Location 1: 'Englisch-Chinesisch', Error Type: Accuracy/Mistranslation, Severity: Minor[SPECIAL_TOK_WENDA]You are evaluating a English-to-German Machine translation task. The source is '(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable. Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information. Sorry, I never thought about it in depth. But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag. So, I put a word into a bag. And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word. And I think that that's the problem with the flicker. If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain. And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not. So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition. Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have. Even though you cannot promise it's good. But I think that we cannot work with this extra information. And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it. If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself. And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly. And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created. Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us. So, I think that it's not good to show extra. Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality. I think that's still better than showing the flicker. Because what would be the real use case? Why would you show the extra information? I think that if you show the extra information, then it's just going to confuse or mislead the reader due to significant change in meaning, and I think that's why we don't like to see it.

But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us. And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us. It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community. We can motivate participants to submit. Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive. So, in archives, people can publish any time, right? So that is not a benefit to their profiles. So how to motivate participants to join our shared task.

The source is '3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with him. I'm not sure if it was because of his personality, or if it was because of the way the book was written, but I did end up enjoying his story.

As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly.

In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence. I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance.

I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck.

After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is.

The source is 'Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.'.

The source is 'I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic. It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me. I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that. However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you. It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.'.

Error Location 1: 'Aussehen des billigen Plastiks', Error Type: Style/Awkward, Severity: Minor[SPECIAL_TOK_WENDA]You are evaluating a English-to-German Machine translation task. The source is 'Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and "in the loop" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.'. The model generated translation is 'Keines der vorherigen Stylo-Modelle, Enttäuschung auf massiver Art und Weise. Ich habe das Originals Stylo sowie Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V und Stylo 2 Plus gekauft.
