I immediately contacted customer service to request a cancellation, and the customer service representative replied that they had already processed the cancellation.", "I checked my phone in the afternoon at 3 o'clock and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again to confirm that this was the third time I had called, and to request that they cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship it!", "The customer service contacted the seller in my presence and informed me that the seller is not familiar with the system and needs to become familiar with it before they can process the cancellation of the order.", "Rest assured, the seller has already been informed and will not ship the order.", "I was speechless when I checked the order on Monday and found that it had already been shipped.", "Unable to directly contact the seller, I had to call customer service again.", "The following handling is beyond words, it's basically me saying one step and the customer service agent operating one step after.", "The order is still in the status of being ready for delivery but refused by the recipient, and it is about to be delivered again!", "\" Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?\"", "\"Anyway, the seller's company has already received the money, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.\"", "I will definitely not make a prepayment for large items in the future, this is too much trouble.", "It looks very nice.", "I have had my eye on this camera for a long time, but I didn't end up buying it due to some other reasons besides the price. This time, since it qualified for free shipping and the price was still reasonable, I ended up purchasing it.", "After purchasing, there are no other issues except that I can't connect to the software. I have a TP router at home, and after searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent over two hours trying various router settings, but in the end, I was able to get it working using 360WIFI as an intermediary. During this time, I contacted Xiaomi's customer service, but they did not have a solution to this", "Additionally, it's worth noting that I've seen user comments online stating that this camera supports a minimum of 8G storage card, and storage with a capacity smaller than that cannot be recognized. I hope everyone takes note of this.", "The device feels usable, and the display is acceptable, but the audio quality is poor.

Maybe I'll just throw it away!", "We have been together for almost three years, but she left me last year, and now when I think of her, I feel a sharp pain in my heart and a desire to leave this world. She was the first woman in my life, and she left a lifelong shadow and heartache that I still haven't been able to move past.", "When buying this phone, I recalled two feelings I had at the time - the comfort in sharing joys and sorrows together, but now it's a regret that I can't bear to look back on. Perhaps that's just how life is - some people never want to encounter certain people or know certain things in their lifetime. But what can one do?", "Every time I see a Samsung phone, I cannot help but think of her, and the pain comes rushing in and fills my whole body. I have never dared to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but I didn't hesitate to buy it for her. No matter how good it is for someone, but when she betrayed me, all the mountains of promises and seas of oaths vanished like smoke and clouds.", "High-end domestic brands", "Huawei is a gem among domestic products.\n\nNote: \"\u56fd\u8d27\" (gu\u00f3 hu\u00f2) means \"domestic products\" or \"made-in-China goods.\" The word \"\u7cbe\u54c1\" (j\u012bng p\u01d0n) means \"gem,\" \"top-quality product,\" or \"fine article.\" In this context, it implies that Huawei is a high-quality brand among Chinese-made products.", "The low-key boss and the company rely on technical expertise and quality to win over customers, which is completely different from the current business culture that relies on advertising to increase name recognition!", "A company without capability cannot and does not dare to do such a thing!", "It was because of this that I chose Huawei.", "I've been using it for more than half a year, and I feel that it has been great, very good.", "The reason for not getting a perfect score is that there was an instance where the offline navigation feature failed to determine my location, and I was unable to find the cause. Other than that, it has worked well.", "Plus, its online input of destinations allows it to automatically design a route after searching, and its offline navigation function is very useful when you set off without wifi, as it can locate and navigate directly through communication with satellites, without consuming data. It's great!", "Sony is awesome.", "Sony's low-end models have a very strong design sense, are affordably priced, have a large screen, and have excellent battery life, making them very suitable for the elderly to use.", "Although a lot of time has passed, this machine still has no problems.", "However, since I downgraded my Z2, this phone has also fulfilled its mission."]}
