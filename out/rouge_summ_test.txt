sum: Sure! Here's the summary of the climactic event of the story based on the passage:

The climactic event of the story is when the water dragon, a creature feared for its ever-changing moods but loved for its kindness, saves the queen's child from drowning in the stormy sea by taking the child in its maw and carrying it to safety. The dragon's actions are motivated by a desire to protect both the mother and the child from the king's darkness and to bring them to the peaceful land of Farlig Dyre, where dragons and humans coexist. The event is climactic because it marks a turning point in the story, as the queen is forced to make a difficult decision to save her child, and the dragon's intervention changes the course of their journey and the fate of the royal family.
ref: Both the king and queen are hanging on to the sides of their watery life raft as the ship burns and begins to sink. The queen has a baby in her arms and screams in horror when she is taken away from her child by the flowing water. She screams to the heavens for help and a water dragon appears to save them. She is horrified as she watches the man in the nearby lifeboat make an attempt to decapitate the dragon who had tried to save the child. The dragon gives a deep growl and submerges underwater, while keeping the child safe in its maw. ******A storm causes a ship to catch fire, and the queen and her child go sailing overboard. The mother hands her child over to a water dragon. When the mother's kin shows up, the dragon takes the child and retreats. The water dragon takes the child to Farlig Dyre and shelters and cares for it.******The queen and her baby fall off a ship during a storm. A water dragon saves the baby from the waters and takes it to its home on Farlig Dyre. They arrive on the island, and the dragon makes a fire to keep the baby warm. There, the water dragon awaits its elders who will give their judgement.******The dramatic event is when all of the people on the ship in a storm are thrown into the sea when lightning strikes near the bow. The queen tries to get on the lifeboat, but the waves throw her and her baby off the ship. She sees a massive water dragon lift up her infant to save it, but the dragon is unable to take the mother. The dragon swims to an island called Farlig Dyr where she places the babe and keeps it dry.******The ship of the royal family is caught in a storm. In the feverish chaos, the queen and her baby accidentally falls into the sea. The baby is rescued by a dragon when the queen's strength fails to hold her child. As the lifeboat approaches the queen, she watches in horror when the dragon dives underwater to take the baby away.******The climax of the story seems to be when the passenger asks the narrator why he thinks of the sledding day as the best day he's ever had. The narrator tenses up after that and begins to explain the realities of being a cab driver.

sum: Based on the passage, the queen changes from a distraught and desperate mother, who is willing to risk her own life to save her child, to a calm and protective figure, who entrusts her child to the care of a water dragon and accepts her fate. At the beginning of the story, the queen is seen as a helpless and vulnerable figure, struggling to survive the storm and protect her child. However, as the story progresses, she becomes more resolute and selfless, putting her child's needs before her own and accepting the dragon's offer of protection. By the end of the story, the queen has transformed into a strong and protective figure, who is willing to accept her fate and trust in the care of the dragon.

She is extremely sad at the end, thinking her child is dead and also possibly dreading being with the king, who, according to the story, has darkness in his heart.******The queen changes significantly over the course of the story. She starts off as a mother concerned for her child's safety in the middle of a storm. Desperate, she turns to a water dragon to save her child. When the dragon dives underwater after seeing the lifeboats approach, the queen is horrified and think that her child will drown so she wants to die. She is extremely sad at the end, thinking her child is dead and also possibly dreading being with the king, who, according to the story, has darkness in his heart.******Initially we see the queen reacting to the ship being hit by lightning and fire. She drops her child and falls into the water, screaming out for her child to be saved. Later her child is taken by a water dragon, who places the child on an island. The queen sinks into the water, exhausted and helpless. She is hauled into the life boat but is inconsolable.******The queen was standing near the bow of the ship with the king, holding her 1-year-old baby close to her, while the storm raged around them. The ship was lost after two direct lightning strikes and the queen and baby was tossed overboard when a wave hit the ship. The queen struggled to hold her baby's head above water while keeping herself afloat with her attire being weighed down. In desperation she hands her baby over to a water dragon to save its life. She screamed in horror as the dragon disappeared with her baby below the waves and longed for the same watery grave, but strong hands pulled her into a life boat. She cried into the king's shoulder for her lost child.

sum: Based on the passage, the origin of Allene's name is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the name Allene is derived from the queen's plea to the gods to "save my baby, please! Save my Allene!" as she watched her child being taken by the water dragon. The use of the name Allene in the queen's plea suggests that it may be a name with special significance or meaning to the queen, and it is possible that it is a name that was given to the child by the queen or her family.

sum: Based on the passage, the text suggests that the concept of cyberbullying is difficult to define and that the New York Senate's attempt to criminalize it in SB2318A is flawed because it does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes cyberbullying. The text states that the law's lack of a definition of cyberbullying is a "gaping hole" and that it is impossible to draft a law that criminalizes conduct that is harmful and wrong because it is subject to constant variation based on unique circumstances. Additionally, the text suggests that the law is a cynical attempt to game the emotions of the electorate and that the senators did not put much effort into drafting a viable law. Overall, the text implies that the concept of cyberbullying is complex and that it is difficult to create a law that effectively addresses it without infringing on free speech.
ref: Cyberbullying is something we think we can identify when we see it, but how exactly is it bullying as opposed to an expression of opinion? Cyberbullying is a crime in New York, but the law defining it is vague and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.******Bullying is a problem and causes harm, but defining what it is in a way that does not violate the First Amendment is nearly impossible. The New York Senate did not attempt to define cyberbullying at all but wrote SB2318A in such a way that cyberbullying is defined as cyberbullying. It might have been their intention that a judge develop the definition because it is extremely difficult to write a law that criminalizes conduct that is harmful and wrong and that is also subject to constant variation based on unique circumstances.******The text mentions that while the Albany County's cyberbullying law was unconstitutional, defining what it is and doing so in a way that doesn't violate the First Amendment is difficult.******It's unclear what cyberbullying is.

sum: Based on the passage, the New York Senate's approach to lawmaking can be summarized as follows:

The New York Senate passed a law (SB2318A) that aims to criminalize cyberbullying, but the law does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes cyberbullying. The law defines "minor" and "person," but does not define cyberbullying itself. The law also does not provide any guidelines or limitations on what constitutes cyberbullying, leaving it open to interpretation by prosecutors and judges. The passage suggests that the law is poorly written and unlikely to pass constitutional muster, as it does not provide a clear definition of cyberbullying and implicates the right to free speech. The New York Senate's approach to lawmaking appears to be more focused on appearing to take action on a popular issue (cyberbullying) rather than actually addressing the issue in a thoughtful and effective manner.

Primož, a hill overgrown with trees, is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It served an important military role during the Second World War due to its location and the presence of many tunnels and bunkers used by the Italian army. The tunnels were part of the long Alpine Wall, a vast series of Italian Defense fortifications, and were constructed only by verified members of the Italian National Fascist Party. The tunnels were secured with steel plates coated with a thick layer of concrete and were long but never used for military purposes. After the withdrawal of Italian forces, local people took valuables from the area, and German forces destroyed the tunnels in fear that allied Partisans would find military use for them.

He hopes to present himself as an alternative to voters who do not like the current Governor, Andrew Cuomo, and plans to campaign on a platform of holding entities like the Board of Regents and Metropolitan Transportation Authority accountable. Sharpe believes he has a good chance of crossing the 50,000-vote threshold needed for the Libertarian Party to become official in New York and potentially win the election.
ref: The author discusses the 2018 New York gubernatorial election. The writer focuses on a candidate named Larry Sharpe. Sharpe, a Libertarian running against Cuomo, had the second-highest contribution by a wide margin raising $102,596 during the filing period, mainly from small donors online. For the past 19 statewide races, Democrats have won each election in New York state. Knowing this, Sharpe was confident that he would defeat his opponent because he chose to run with the Libertarian Party. ******13 of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees were confirmed as part of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's effort to reshape the nation's court for years to come.

Typical turnout for Libertarian candidates in New York gubernatorial races has been low, with the party rarely gaining more than 1% of the vote. In the past, Libertarian candidates have not been competitive in the political lineup, with the two major parties, Democrats and Republicans, dominating the political landscape. However, the passage suggests that Larry Sharpe, the Libertarian candidate in the 2018 race, may be an exception to this trend, as he has gained a significant following and raised a substantial amount of money, potentially positioning himself as a viable alternative to the two major party candidates.
ref: The typical turnout for a Libertarian candidate is about four million New Yorkers, who are not be the decisive factor in deciding the winner of the gubernatorial race. Third-party candidates have rarely been competitive in New York’s gubernatorial races.

The text also mentions that each of these damage types has "status effects" that can be applied based on a "procedural random chance" percentage, and that these effects will be changing. Specifically, Impact and Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt, while Slash will continue to stack multiple status effects on top of one another. Additionally, the text notes that the changes are intended to make Impact and Puncture more competitive with Slash, and that the systemic change is intended to create a more interesting gameplay experience.

Based on the passage, the text says that the process of leveling the field involves making changes to the IPS status effects and proc damage calculation to improve Impact and Puncture procs, making them scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt. Additionally, the text states that Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction based on the damage dealt at the time of proc, and that Slash will continue to stack multiple status effects on top of one another.
ref: The text's author says they were inspired by Khora, the next warframe and so something from the update will adjust physical damage in broad terms by changing the way impact and puncture damage affect enemy enemies. Adjustments will make impacts and punctures scale in effectiveness based on the damage of the weapon that causes it.

These damage types have their corresponding "status effects" which can be applied to the enemies. Status procs have a "procedural random chance" percentage, which is typically referred to as "procs". Status effects can cause an enemy to stagger, reducing damage output by a flat 30%, inflicted by the puncture proc or inflicting "bleed" damage over time, inflicted by the slash proc.

sum: Sure! Based on the passage, here's the answer to your question:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

The text states that damage-scaling procs for Impact and Puncture will now scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt. This means that an Impact proc with a small damage output will only cause a short stagger, while an Impact proc with high damage output can scale up to a ragdoll, temporarily immobilizing the enemy. Similarly, Puncture procs will scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction based on the damage dealt. Slash procs will continue to stack multiple status effects on top of each other. Additionally, repeating procs will not reproc, but will instead additively increase the effectiveness of the existing proc.
ref: In order to incentivize players to perform large-amount damage with weapons, status-inflicting procs will now scale in effectiveness the more damage they do. Also, additional status effects will increase the effectiveness of the existing proc instead of simply applying a "reproc."******The developers will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. Their primary goal is improving Impact and Puncture. Currently, Impact inflicts a staggering effect, Puncture reduces the enemy’s damage output by 30%, and Slash inflicts bleed damage.******The developers will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation.

The fridge, and specifically the ketchup bottle, becomes a symbol of the power struggles they face in their daily lives. The ketchup bottle's refusal to stay closed and its "resistance" to being moved to a different spot in the fridge represents the obstacles and challenges that the roommates face in their daily lives. The fact that the ketchup bottle is the source of the problem, but also the solution, highlights the idea that the things we need to survive (in this case, food) can also be the source of our struggles and challenges. The story also suggests that even in the face of adversity, we can find a sense of control and balance by finding the right solution (in this case, keeping the ketchup bottle parallel to the door). Overall, the symbolism of food in this story is one of struggle, control, and balance.
ref: There are two kinds of food in this story: real food and condiments. The real food is the food that the characters use to satiate their hunger, such as the apples, carrots, hot dogs, and soup. The condiments are the ketchup and Sriracha, which are used to add flavor to the food.

0.2992125934329469
sum: Sure! Here's the summary you requested:

The singular source of tension in the story is the malfunctioning refrigerator door that refuses to stay shut, causing frustration and inconvenience for the two roommates. The tension is resolved when one of the roommates, Devon, discovers that the ketchup bottle inside the fridge is causing the door to open every time it is turned horizontally. The solution is to keep the ketchup bottle parallel to the door, which restores balance and harmony to the kitchen. The ketchup bottle becomes a symbol of power and control in the kitchen, and the roommates learn to respect and obey its "whims."
ref: The singular source of tension in the story is the fridge door that refused to stay shut. The fridge door would tease them by feigning closure, then mockingly swing open. The fridge drove the housemates insane. They took the drawers and the shelfs out to readjust the magnetic strips. Nothing worked. The fridge would recurrently switch its magnetic strip to repel mode. It was not until later that my housemate figured out the cause. The ketchup bottle was the singular source of tension in the story and how it was resolved.

The passage also highlights the many tasks that the squire is required to perform for the knight, such as serving him food, cleaning up after him, and fetching his horse for hunting expeditions. Overall, the excerpt portrays the knight as a clumsy, inept, and foolish individual.
ref: The knight is lousy and ungrateful, and he doesn't even know his squire's name. He is also stupid enough that he doesn't know which end of the sword to use, and he has trouble putting on his helmet. He also needs a lot of help with basic tasks, and it's the job of the squire to provide them.******In the excerpt, the narrator, Squire Perry, explains that he is this knight's assistant, doing tasks that the knight is unable to do.

Additionally, the passage states that Lesly's love for the monster had "exited her" after she killed Larry, implying that she may have lost her maternal instincts and emotional connection to her son.

Instead, the passage suggests that the monster's upbringing and experiences have already had a profound and lasting impact on his development, and that he may be predisposed to violence and aggression himself.

sum: Based on the passage, it is hard for critics to accept that Mikhail Lesin killed himself because the official cause of death was initially reported as a heart attack, and the autopsy report later revealed that he died from blunt force injuries to the head, neck, torso, upper extremities, and lower extremities, which were allegedly self-inflicted. Additionally, the FBI report states that Lesin's death was caused by falls, with acute ethanol intoxication, which some critics have questioned as a plausible explanation for the extent of his injuries. The fact that the US authorities refused to allow Russian authorities to cooperate in the investigation and that the remaining pages of the autopsy report were heavily redacted have also fueled speculation and skepticism about the official cause of death.

sum: Based on the passage, the term "aquapelago" has expanded from a scientific term to a cultural concept through its association with various disciplines and themes. Initially introduced as a scientific term to describe marine and terrestrial elements in island environments, the concept has been further developed and applied to various cultural contexts. For instance, the concept of "aquapelagic imaginary" has been explored in relation to media and popular culture, such as mermaid myths and folklore, and its connection to the "social imaginary" has been discussed. Additionally, the term has been applied to urban settings, such as Manhattan, and has been used to analyze cultural practices in Melanesian coastal societies and career making in island communities. Overall, the passage suggests that the term "aquapelago" has expanded from a purely scientific term to a multidisciplinary concept that encompasses both scientific and cultural aspects of island environments and their relationships with the sea.
ref: The term "aquapelago" was introduced by contributors to Shima, an online journal of research into island and maritime cultures.  Aquapelago, as a term, is a collection of marine and land elements that are key to the livelihood of nearby communities as well as their sense of identity. Since it was coined, there has been positive engagement with the term, so much so that the concept has extended into the imaginary and folklore territory where communities engagement with tales of mermaids are being brought into the matrix of aquapelago.******The original definition of aquapelago introduced by Philip Hayward specified their applicability to island communities. Over time, the concept has expanded to consider the role of marine spaces in metropolitan locales, the influences of media-lore on perceptions of the marine environment.******The concept of "aquapelago" has expanded from its use by scientists to explore the role of marine elements in island formations to include a consideration of how these elements play into cultural contexts, specifically folklore and media-lore. It has also been applied to metropolitan locales in order to consider how these spaces are imagined and act as collective agents.******The term _aquapelago_ was introduced to the field of Island Studies in 2012. Suwa’s concept is striking in that it conceives of combined terrestrial and aquatic spaces as, effectively, neighborhoods. One significant development of the concept of the aquapelago has concerned the notion of there being an “aquapelagic imaginary.” on mermaids, and mer-cultures.

sum: Sure! Here's the summary you requested based on the provided passage:

The article discusses the disbanding of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity and the shift in investigating voter fraud to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Despite Democrat opposition, the commission had documented 8,471 cases of double-voting in 21 states and 938 voter fraud convictions since 2000. The article highlights the irony of Democrat resistance to DHS investigations while supporting investigations into President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. The passage also notes that 12 states allow illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses and that many states have lax voter registration and voting procedures, which can contribute to voter fraud. Overall, the article suggests that Democrats' opposition to investigating voter fraud is selective and that they may regret their stance as DHS continues its investigation.
ref: Schumer asserts that combating voter fraud is a means to suppress the vote. However, voter fraud is considered to be reasonably widespread by the majority of Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has comparatively more investigatory power than the commission, so the investigation will be more efficiently handled.******The article discusses the disbandment of President Trump's election integrity commission. It indicates that voter fraud is a widespread concern in the American population, with more people concerned than not. Although an overwhelming majority of Americans consider voter fraud to be widespread, some leftists insist that voter fraud is not a problem, and argue that efforts to examine the issue are "disenfranchisement." As such, despite the disbandment of the Commission, the Department of Homeland Security is asked to step in and pursue investigations of voter fraud.******Schumer asserts that combating voter fraud is a means to suppress the vote. However, voter fraud is considered to be reasonably widespread by the majority of Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has comparatively more investigatory power than the commission, so the investigation will be more efficiently handled.******The article discusses the disbandment of Trump's election integrity commission amid Democratic criticism and reluctance to cooperate with investigations into potential voter fraud. It notes that despite some evidence of voter fraud, Democrats are opposed to attempts to investigate or remedy potential issues. Republicans dissolved the commission due to the resistance from Democrats and potential ineffectiveness, but argue that the investigation will continue through the Department of Homeland Security. The article also highlights several possible avenues for voter fraud, including online registration, voter ID laws and hacking concerns.******The author submits and maintains that voter fraud is a possibility in many states for reasons that the author largely attributes to Democrat policies. Factors like allowing immigrants who don't yet have a legal status in this country to obtain driver's licenses contribute to voter fraud, according to the author. The issue is further problematic because 38 states allow or will allow soon for registering online to vote.
============================108=============================
0.32743362388401603
sum: Based on the passage, Democrats believe that their policies on voting procedures are right because they believe that efforts to investigate voter fraud are a front to suppress the vote and perpetuate baseless claims. They also believe that lax registration and voting procedures, coupled with resistance to investigations, has a minimal impact on the integrity of elections. Additionally, they argue that any effort to conduct an investigation that might reveal fraud or validate their assertions is a wild-goose chase and would only make voting harder with unnecessary barriers. They are selectively critical of investigations that might be inimical to their interests, while supporting investigations that might delegitimize the current president.
ref: They are certain their more relaxed policies on registration and procedures does not affect the outcome of elections. The Democrats think the potential hacking by Russians needs a special committee for investigation while asserting that the Republicans are trying to make voting harder. The author posits that the Democrats support all investigations that could discredit their opposition while opposing any that would be inimical to their interests.******The author presents evidence on double voting and voter fraud stats (8,471 cases of double voting in 21 states). The Democrats state that such investigations are discriminating against Americans who are trying to vote and that final results aren't affected. They also state that there is a danger of disenfranchisement if DHS and other government agencies come to check fraudulent voting. The author feels that such fears of investigations are unfounded and selective, citing the Democrats' desire for a special committee to investigate Trump's ties to Russia.******They are certain their more relaxed policies on registration and procedures does not affect the outcome of elections.

The author posits that the Democrats support all investigations that could discredit their opposition while opposing any that would be inimical to their interests.******Democrat politicians and organizations contend their policies on voting procedures are right because they favor more access to the ballot and protections for voters, as compared to ensuring the integrity of the voting process by investigating possible cases of voter fraud.******According to the author, Democrats believe their policies on voting procedures are right because they are concerned primarily with preventing voter suppression, not fraud. Thus, any attempt by Homeland Security to investigate voter fraud, even though such fraud has been documented, would be seen as disenfranchisement by Democrats. Furthermore, Democrats want a Special Counsel to probe Trump's alleged collusion with Russia, and the author finds the Democrats' desire of investigating election integrity to be selective.

 Initially, the people were in a state of confusion and curiosity as they watched the masked figures abseil down the screen and heard the man with the deep monotone voice declare that they were there to liberate them from the prison they lived in.

However, as the message continued, the people began to feel a sense of unease and fear as they realized that the MOXERS were not affiliated with the government and their intentions were not clear. The word "freedom" painted on the screen was met with a mix of excitement and skepticism, as some people began to chant "This is the hate of the old age!"

As the situation escalated and the MOXERS were met with resistance from the military, the people's emotions turned to panic and chaos. The sound of gunshots and screams filled the air, and people began to run for their lives, desperate to escape the violence.

Overall, the emotions of the people during this time were complex and varied, ranging from curiosity and confusion to fear, panic, and despair.

Masked soldiers threw gas into the crowd with loud gunshots being heard above the confusion that ensued. The death toll was very high, there were bodies lying all over, some dying out and others already dead. There was panic and fear - the main character ran away in terror, vomiting up his breakfast in nausea.******The MoXERS' revolution message alongside the violence wreaked by the masked soldiers fueled fear and a feeling of powerlessness in the people present.

They would have continued to live in a state of fear and surveillance, with the constant threat of punishment or worse for any dissent or non-compliance. The word "freedom" would likely have remained a distant dream, and the idea of rebellion or resistance would have been unthinkable. Instead, Adam and his family would have likely been trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty, oppression, and despair.

This was a challenging task, as the community was used to defecating in the open and saw no need for toilets.

Secondly, Devi had to overcome the lack of funds to build the toilets. She had to raise 100,000 rupees, which was a significant amount of money for her community. She managed to raise some funds through local corporations, but she also had to overcome the fear of the community that there must be a secret agenda behind the offer of help.

Thirdly, Devi had to overcome the lack of support from her husband and son-in-law, who passed away, leaving her as the sole breadwinner for her daughter and two grandchildren. This made it difficult for her to pursue her work, but she remained determined to provide for her family and improve the living conditions in her community.

Finally, Devi had to overcome the challenges of walking long distances in pouring rain to reach the construction site, as there were no public transportation facilities available. Despite these difficulties, Devi remained determined to build toilets and improve the living conditions in her community.
ref: Locals resisted giving funds, and simply denied she needed financial help because they said she had a ”secret agenda.” The shanty town of Rakhi Mandi also had a history of siting feces within the area, and Devi went out to build the toilets having to walk some days in the pouring rain for 5 km after taking two bus rides.******Devi faced countless difficulties in her efforts to improve cleanliness in her community. She faced skepticism from those who believed there was a secret agenda behind the project. She also had to walk long distances in inclement weather to get to her building sites. Additionally, she has to deal with the death of her husband and son-in-law, who were crucial to her success. Through all these hardships she has now received the Nari Shakti Puraskar for her work in providing toilets and improving conditions for women and children in Kanpur.******The people in her husband's community were not cooperative with her hunger venture to embellish the sanitation in their area.

sum: Based on the passage, the narrator handles his impending death with a mix of emotions and inner thoughts. He is initially described as feeling "foolish" and "anxious" as he sits in the waiting room, trying to avoid eye contact with others. When the administrator delivers the news that further treatments will not improve his health and that he has only a few months left, the narrator becomes silent and introspective, thinking about his family and his own mortality.

However, instead of becoming overwhelmed by despair, the narrator finds solace in the small details of his surroundings, such as the color of the carpet (which he finally identifies as "taupe") and the soft lining of his trouser pockets. These observations give him a sense of comfort and familiarity, allowing him to cope with the news in a more measured way.

sum: Sure! Here's the summary you requested:

During summers in Australia, native animals face many hardships, including extreme heat, lack of access to water, and habitat loss due to bushfires. Many animals suffer terribly and even die during heat waves, and those who survive may be left without food sources due to the destruction of their habitats. To make matters worse, many animals are at risk of drowning in pools or becoming trapped in deep dishes, and heat-stressed animals may be more vulnerable to predators. To help, people can provide shallow dishes of water in the shade, keep their dogs and cats indoors, cover their pools, and be on the lookout for heat-stressed wildlife. Additionally, sharing fruit trees with hungry wildlife and preparing an emergency kit can also make a difference.
ref: Australian summers can be tough for wildlife. Heatwaves make the heat even worse, often causing the death of animals.

0.1518987312610159
sum: Sure! Here is a summary of some of the counter-intuitive measures one can take to cool down an animal friend based on the passage:

1. Do not provide water: The passage advises against providing water to heat-stressed animals, as it can actually cause more harm than good. Instead, provide cool water in a bowl and allow the animal to lap it up.
2. Keep dogs and cats indoors: The passage suggests keeping dogs and cats indoors during hot weather to prevent them from overheating and to enable thirsty wildlife to access water in the backyard safely.
3. Cover your pool: The passage advises covering your pool to prevent heat-stressed animals from drowning in it. Instead, provide a safe and fresh water source in your backyard.
4. Prepare an emergency kit: The passage suggests preparing an emergency kit with water, a blanket/towel, and a box to keep in your car in case you need to transport an injured animal to a vet.
5. Share your fruit trees: The passage encourages sharing fruit trees with hungry wildlife, especially flying foxes, to help them survive after extreme heat events and bushfires.

Overall, the passage highlights the importance of taking counter-intuitive measures to help animal friends cope with hot weather, such as keeping them indoors, covering pools, and providing fresh water sources.
ref: It is not ideal for an animal to be drinking pool water. One should take away an animal's access to a pool. Outside access to water should be provided with shallow bowls to avoid drowning the animals.

sum: Based on the passage, it is not explicitly stated what motivates Jerry to kill all these women, but we can infer some possible reasons:

1. Loneliness and rejection: Jerry is described as a loner who was always cast aside and forgotten without a second guess. He may be using these murders as a way to cope with his own feelings of rejection and loneliness.
2. Insecurity and low self-esteem: Jerry has a low opinion of himself, as evidenced by his habit of apologizing after each murder. He may be using these killings to boost his own self-worth and feel powerful for a change.
3. Desire for control: Jerry seems to have a need for control in his life, as he carefully plans and executes each murder. He may be using these acts to exert control over his own chaotic and painful past.
4. Trauma: Jerry's past experience with a gun and the loss of his previous lover, Beth, may have traumatized him and contributed to his desire to hurt others.

It's important to note that these are just inferences based on the passage and that the true motivations behind Jerry's actions may be more complex and multifaceted.

sum: Sure! Here's the summary you requested:

The poem "Reuben Bright" by Edwin Arlington Robinson has been used in teaching literature due to its unique structure and themes. It is a modified Petrarchan sonnet with a bizarre and extraordinary story, which makes it a revolutionary piece of poetry. The poem's use of plain-speaking, intimately conversational language and its tension between matter-of-fact language and psychological depths have made it a valuable teaching tool. The poem's narrative elements and ironic twist at the end have also been noted as effective tools for teaching poetry to students who may have become jaded with traditional sonnets. Additionally, the poem's focus on "ordinary" people and their human condition makes it relatable and accessible to students. The poem has been suggested as a useful teaching tool for rewriting as a short story or play, and has been used to teach poetry techniques such as structure, language, and theme.
ref: Unlike most sonnets, Reuben Bright is written in ordinary layman's language. This may appeal to students who are jaded by the language of traditional sonnets. Teachers can challenge students to try and figure out how the shocking ending results from the death of Bright's wife. Milton Stern points out that Robinson takes ordinary people, leading ordinary lives and "finds therein the dramatic, the poetic and the human."******The poem may be useful for teaching students who might have gotten jaded by traditional sonets. The poem is used to help the students see that poetry does indeed speak to the human condition. The use of common words and not traditional poetic elements helps the student grasp the concept better.

0.5868263424561656
sum: Based on the passage, the reasons for supporting the development of meat-mimicking food include:

1. Environmental benefits: Traditional animal farming is reported to account for 18% of all greenhouse emissions, use 47,000 square miles of land annually, and exhaust 70% of the world's water. Meat-mimicking food could help reduce the environmental impact of farming.
2. Sustainability: The new research suggests that without dairy and meat consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by over 75% and still feed the world.
3. Improved food security: The leaders of the national and global meat industry want to feed the world animal protein in a sustainable way, and meat-mimicking food could help achieve this goal.
4. Reduced animal suffering: Lab-grown meat and plant-based meat companies argue that their products are more environmentally friendly than raising traditional livestock, which could reduce animal suffering.
ref: The text states that proponents of meat-mimicking food argue that it's more environmentally friendly than raising traditional livestock. The new research suggests that without dairy and meat consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by over 75% - an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union, and Australia combined - and still feed the world.

0.0
sum: Based on the passage, there is no direct mention of public opinion on meat-mimicking food. However, it can be inferred that the public may be confused by the labeling of plant-based meat products next to traditional meat items, as argued by the US Cattlemen's Association (USCA). The USCA has filed a petition to the USDA to strictly define "meat" and "beef" as animals raised and slaughtered, which could suggest that the public may not fully understand the difference between traditional meat and plant-based or lab-grown alternatives. However, the passage also mentions that plant-based meat companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have gained traction in the market and have received significant investments from venture capitalists, which could indicate that there is a growing demand for meat-mimicking food options.

The plot twist in the story is that the fifth card, which Pete was given as the final card, had the number 76 written on the bottom in ink, indicating that the game was rigged and the outcome was predetermined. The story suggests that the game was not just a simple card game, but a metaphor for life, where people are given opportunities and must make decisions based on uncertainty. The twist adds a layer of complexity to the story, as it raises questions about the nature of the game and the intentions of the person who designed it. It also adds a sense of irony to the story, as Pete's desire for a better opportunity ultimately led to him being given a card that was predetermined to have a low value.

The card turned from blank to displaying the number "76" because the narrator, who is the game's creator, had written the number "76" on the back of the card before giving it to Pete. The narrator reveals this in the last sentence of the passage, saying that they "glanced at the bottom of the fifth card" and saw that "seventy-six was written in ink."
